<p>She met Ronald Reagan in 1951. At that time Reagan was the president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG). Another actress with the same name (of Nancy) had appeared in a Hollywood blacklist. This name confusion had created problems for Nancy. Anyone with his or her name in the Hollywood blacklist was unable to get any work in any movie. As she would not get any roles due to the name in the Hollywood blacklist, she met Reagan to clear this issue. Over a period of time, they came closer to each other. They married on 4th March 1952 in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>. Nancy once remembered: "My life really began when I married my husband." <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/firstladies/nr40.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/firstladies/nr40.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>The Reagans had two children. She gave birth to a daughter Patti Davis on 21st October 1952, seven months after the couple's wedding. She gave birth to a son named Ron Reagan on 20th May 1958. Nancy Reagan is also stepmother to Michael Reagan and the late Maureen Reagan, the children of Ronald Reagan's first marriage to actress Jane Wyman.</p>

<p>Ronald Reagan was governor of California for two terms, from 1967 to 1975. During this period, Nancy Reagan was the First Lady of California.</p>
<p>The officials of the fire department had described official residence of the Governor in <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacramento%2C_California_50bc.html" title="Sacramento, California">Sacramento, California</a> as a “firetrap”. She, therefore, shifted to a wealthy suburb. Some people thought the shifting as an arrogant step.</p>
<p>She was very active as the First lady of California. She visited war veterans, the elderly persons, and the handicapped persons. She also worked with many groups working for charity. One such program was the Foster Grandparent Program. She continued her association with the Foster grandparent program when she came to the Washington as the First Lady of the United States.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../n/a/n/Nancy_Reagan_c4a7.html" title="Edit section: The First Lady">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The First Lady</span></h2>
<p>When Ronald Reagan became the president of the United States in 1981, Nancy Reagan began her role actively as the First Lady.</p>
<p>In her early years as the First Lady, a private foundation purchased new dishware for the White House. The cost was $ 200,000. This attracted bad publicity, as the US economy was facing recession at that time. She also used expensive fashion. This also attracted bad publicity sometimes. However, once in 1982 at Gridiron Club, she dressed in ragged clothes and sang "Second-Hand Rose". <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-06-13-nancy-reagan_x.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-06-13-nancy-reagan_x.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. This lessened the criticism to some extent.</p>
<p>Nancy Reagan took close interest in the affairs of the White House. Some people believe that she exercised some influence over many matters, particularly during her husband’s second term as the President of the United States. People also remember her for conservative fashions copied by many women of her time. She was also against use of drugs by young persons.</p>
<p>She also got interested in astrology as the First Lady. She used the services of Joan Quigley who was an astrologer. In 1981, her husband faced an assassination attempt. This made Nancy rely on astrology and she tried to influence appointments and movements of her husband based on astrology. At that time the White House Chief of Staff was Donald Regan. He did not find this very useful. There was a struggle between Donald Regan and the First Lady. Donald Regan resigned in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>.</p>
<p>In October <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, physicians found that Nancy Reagan had breast cancer. She underwent an operation, mastectomy.</p>
<p>In 1991 Kitty Kelley wrote a book about her. The book’s name is <i>Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized Biography</i>. The book became very famous and sold many copies. The book gives certain details like the former First Lady's association with astrology and White House meetings with <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Sinatra_d0f7.html" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>.</p>
<p>In 1983 Reagan, Henry Kissinger (former Secretary of State) and philanthropists Barbara and Marvin Davis, appeared in an episode of the very popular soap opera Dynasty (TV series). In addition, Reagan appeared as herself in an episode of the popular sitcom <i>Diff'rent Strokes</i> to underscore her support for her "Just Say No" anti-drug campaign.</p>
