<p>Supposably I want to find an answer to a question like: How did the Civil war start, or something like that. How would I be able to find an answer like that? If WP doesn't have it, then it should get it. In my opinion, I think we should expand the whole wikipedia idea, but that's just me.</p>

<p>Hello, there seems to be agreement that using a second person ("you ..") is a bad thing to do in an article. This is partly so, because it makes assumptions on the part of the person reading it. In the how to write simple English articles, an excample is given that a passive form can/should be replaced by a first person (In the style of "we can see" instead of "it can be seen"). Personally, I think this is problematic, because it again makes an assumption about the reader. This lead to a short discussion between <a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimshot_f600.html" title="User:Rimshot">User:Rimshot</a> and myself; the user replaced the passive as directed on the page <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">Information</a>. Both of us have again reached agreement. The question is now, how the community sees this practice? --<a href="../../../e/p/t/User%7EEptalon_a472.html" title="User:Eptalon">Eptalon</a> 12:34, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As Eptalon said, I am <b>for</b> the use of we in this sense. As I see it, the main argument <i>for</i> using we is that it makes the texts easier readable by avoiding passive constructs. The main argument <i>against</i> using it is that it is unencyclopedic. The English WP <a href="../../../../en/m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" class="extiw" title="en:Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style">Manual of Style</a> says that <i>we</i> might be used in the sense of <i>When we open our eyes, we see something</i>. Maybe this should be made clear in the manual for the simple English WP as well. <a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimshot_f600.html" title="User:Rimshot">Rimshot</a> 12:47, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Those are both good points raised by Rimshot and Eptalon. The only problem that I have with it is that I think that the first person shouldn't be used in articles at all. The idea that the first person gives me here is that some elite group is going around writing these articles, which is not the case. But that isn't my argument. I believe that it should not be used because the passive voice is taught very early in language. Just for comparison, when I learned Latin so long ago, the passive voice was taught before we moved into sentence structure (e.g. Videt - It sees and Videtur - It is seen/It can be seen). If the person is learning English on their own, the passive voice is something that they <i>need</i> to know for them to be able to understand English conversations. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">PullToOpen</a><sup><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">Talk</a></sup> 13:14, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been watching what the English Wikipedia has been doing to salt pages, and they came up with a good idea. Before, salted pages were protected and had a special template added to them. This worked fine, but they could be accessed through <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">Special:Randompage</a>. I transcluded all of the now-salted pages onto another page <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtected_deleted_pages_List_2f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Protected deleted pages/List">Wikipedia:Protected deleted pages/List</a> (just a warning - the page makes no sense as of now). When the page is protected using cascading protection, all of the pages that are transcluded are protected as well, regardless of whether they exist or not. Cool, isn't it? <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">PullToOpen</a><sup><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">Talk</a></sup> 21:58, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that it is a judgement that is hard to make on a "wholesale" (all direct copying is bad) approach. There are articles in enWP that are simple enough to be copied, or nearly simple enough.

<dd><i>Originally, Pinocchio was to be depicted as a Charlie McCarthy-esque wise guy, equally <b>rambunctious</b> and sarcastic, just like in the original novel. <b>He looked exactly like a real wooden puppet with, among other things, a long pointed nose, a peaked cap, and bare wooden hands.</b> But Walt found that no one could really sympathize with such a character and so the designers had to redesign the puppet as much as possible. <b>Eventually, they revised the puppet to make him look more like a real boy, with, among other things, a button nose, a child's Tyrolean hat, and regular, four-fingered hands with Mickey Mouse-type gloves on them.</b> The only parts of him that still looked more or less like a puppet were his arms and legs. (..)Additionally, it was at this stage that the character of the cricket was expanded. Jiminy Cricket (voiced by Cliff "Ukelele Ike" Edwards) became central to the story. Originally, he was depicted as an actual (<b>albeit less anthropomorphized</b>) cricket with toothed legs and waving anntenae. But again Walt wanted someone more likable, so Ward Kimball conjured up "a little man with no ears. That was the only thing about him that was like an insect."</i></dd>

</dd>
<dd>(section above from the Pinocchio article).The passages marked in <b>bold</b> clearly make this unsimple. Our audience is not likely to know the meaning of the word rambunctious. Also the whole sentences marked should be made shorter.

<dd>I think that articles copied whole-sale from en.wikipedia generate lots of work. Badly written articles generate work as well, but there's a difference: While someone at least made an effort in the latter case, in the first case the effort of the copier is very little. Therefore, deleting such articles can easier be justified.</dd>

<dd>I agree with Eptalon that <i>copying over the article, and then editing it to better fit SEWPs needs might be a valid approach</i>. I think, however, that there should be an indication that the person who copied the article <i>does</i> have the intention of editing it to make it fit Simple WP.

<dd>The example articles fulfill all of these requirements. Given the number of copied articles, the cited case borders on vandalism, in my view.

If anyone wants to do a Pinocchio article based on the enWP content, they can do so.

<p>Hello, I have subdivided this broad category into Old units of measurement, Imperial units of measurement, and SI units. Using the same mechanism, a division could be made into units to measure length, area/surface, volume, etc. Also, a cat Metric units could be introduced. Like always, a category, with only two or three entries in it looks bad. On the other hand, if categories get full, new classifications can clear up things. Other problems: The Metre is an SI unit, and is in the respective category. The kilometre (defined as 1.000 meters) is still in category:Measurement.</p>

<dd>Actually I interwiki-linked <a href="../../../s/i/_/Category%7ESI_units_6ad5.html" title="Category:SI units">Category:SI units</a> with the respective enWP category before reading this. It is certainly a useful category. I think <i>SI units</i> should contain all SI units, including derived units like kilometre. This is the way it is handled in the enWP as well. If <i>SI units</i> gets too full, it is possible to make subcategories <i>SI base units</i> and <i>SI derived units</i>. I don't think there are enough unit articles now to make that necessary. As for the other categories (old and imperial), imperial certainly makes sense. I am not so sure about <i>old</i>. --<a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimshot_f600.html" title="User:Rimshot">Rimshot</a> 16:41, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hm, OK. Maybe I am too far removed from school mathematics. Measurements are an application of mathematics, for example in trigonometry. Units are often given to give a lesson more a practical feel. They are rarely necessary. Trigonometry is different in that it is often thought of as tied to lengths, even if some applications of trigonometry don't actually work with lengths (lengths in metres, that is). Of course you can integrate over Amperes or Pints, but that doesn't make them a mathematical topic. That is just my opinion of course. As there is a consensus over keeping measurement a subcategory of mathematics, it should stay there. --<a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimshot_f600.html" title="User:Rimshot">Rimshot</a> 12:23, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I too think that <i>unsimple</i> is not a very nice word.

There is one thing good about <i>unsimple</i>, however. It clearly shows, by being an invented word, that the opposite of <i>simple</i>, as defined here, is meant. If a page is tagged <i>unsimple</i>, it is clear that it does not use simple English. If a page is tagged <i>complex</i> that could also mean that its content is complex. I would therefore prefer at least a little discussion before going ahead and changing the wording everywhere. --<a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimshot_f600.html" title="User:Rimshot">Rimshot</a> 10:50, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An article is rarely too simple, in my view. If it looks strange to you, that might also be because you looked at it so many times.

<p>Hello, I have created a few articles in category economics, and also made a category for the different market forms. There are philosophical systems of thought, like Communism, Capitalism, Marxism, Liberalism, Neoliberalism... These of course have an influence on the economic systems of the countries that have them. They should therefore be in Cat:Economics. On the other hand, many of them are clearly in cat:Philosophy. We need a new cat for them, they are currently in the same cat as Monarchy, Democracy,... (which are forms of state).</p>

<dd><i>Economic Systems</i>, I think should be a member of <i>Economy</i> and <i>Systems</i>. To get philosophy in there, how about a category named <i>Economic philosophies</i> or <i>Economic ideologies</i>? The first seems more neutral, and therefore preferable. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a> for example is an economic as well as a political philosophy. It is also a form of state. It is not, however, a system of economy - that would be <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialism</a>. I think we need the following three categories: <i>Economic systems</i>, <i>Economic philosophies</i> and <i>Political philosophies</i>. The existing <i>Forms of government</i> should probably be multi-rooted in <i>Political philosophies</i> and <i>Systems</i>, maybe <i>Politics</i> as well.--<a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimshot_f600.html" title="User:Rimshot">Rimshot</a> 11:00, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
