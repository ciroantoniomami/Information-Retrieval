<p>Should there be a rule as to how many words a sentence in an article which is not a quote should have? I see that many articles already approach typical Wikipedia prose with paragraph-long sentences. Perhaps a limit of 20-25 words per sentence would be useful.Eloquence 11:06, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd like to avoid any strict rules on word count as it isn't a very practical thing to enforce, but on first glance, even 20-25 seems quite long. A better way if just to try to aim for one concept per sentence, rather than worrying too much about the number of words. So, use a new sentence where you might otherwise have used a comma. A lot of the pages here currently are <i>not</i> simple enough, so they shouldn't necessarily be used as a guide. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 19:54, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have changed difficult words into several words which say the same. Many difficult words are links. When should we simplify words which are links?</p>
<p>The <i>pipe trick</i> may help, or maybe it does not. Should we try to have many difficult words remain in the article as links to articles which explain them?</p>
<p>Or would it be better to have them at the end of the article? I do not mean that we would have them as a list of links. The idea I got was that maybe we should have the words which might be links as a list of short explanations (a <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossary.html" title="Glossary">glossary</a>). I will show what I mean below:</p>
<dl>
<dt><b><a href="../../../p/i/p/Pipe.html" title="Pipe">pipe</a></b></dt>
<dd>is a word to do with <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computers</a> which means moving <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data.html" title="Data">data</a> from one <a href="../../../p/r/o/Program.html" title="Program">program</a> which works alone to another program working alone. It can also mean telling some program to get data for itself from somewhere else than the place which is given more visibly.</dd>
<dt><b>glossary</b></dt>
<dd>is a list of short explanations of what words mean. It is often put where a text has words that are difficult.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I mean explanations like that. Then we could have simple words in the article. The more difficult words that have to do with the matter of the article, would still be with it. -- <a href="../../../c/i/m/User%7ECimon_Avaro_6721.html" title="User:Cimon Avaro">C I M O N</a> 12:21, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think avoiding the difficult words is a better option. Where they are linked, it may be because the original author couldn't think of a way of simplifying it, so went with the alternative of explaining it in another article, but if this can be avoided, that would be a good thing. The glossary is a good idea, particularly where there are technical words that would be common in a normal text but have been omitted here, as it would help people when they then have to read normal texts on the topic. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 19:58, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry for my sarcasm, but I think if this is to be Simple English, it should be "trying not to use" instead of "avoiding" and "the one who wrote it in first place" instead of "the original author" or "make it easier" instead of "simpflify". User:Jakob Stevo</dd>

<dd>Often the editors here will have good English. It's harder to write in Simple English than it is to write normally, so I doubt any regulars here would have problems.

<dd>I think that you are allowed to copy them to Wiktionary as long as you attribute the authors in the edit summary when you save the page there, and note where it came from. I think they should not be deleted from here though as most of them are a start to an article, which will hopefully improve to be much more than a simple definition later on. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 00:35, 26 Jan 2004 (PST)</dd>

<p>Have you ever thought of making this a Wikipedia for Kids? There are many versions of Wikipedia right now so it may seems that everyone would contribute to their language version. I'm just wondering cuz it seems that an article like <a href="../../../../en/s/e/d/Sedna_%28astronomical_object%29.html" class="extiw" title="en:Sedna_(astronomical_object)">en:Sedna (astronomical object)</a> doesn't seem to be good for a K-6 kid, but the Simple English version would be great for them. Thoughts?</p>

<p>In my opinion there is a big difference between a dictionary for kids and one for simple english speakers:</p>
<ul>
<li>dictionaries for kids try to describe the world's entities in a simplified and non-ambiguous manner, leaving out complex thoughts which only can be understood with a broader amount of life experience</li>
<li>dictionaries for adults with low language experience just avoid special idiomatic terms that are conventional shortcuts (symbols) for specific well-known circumstances, since most simple english speakers are likely to be grown-up and mostly know these circumstances but don't know the respective idiomatic terms</li>

<p>I'm not sure. I don't like having tags on too many articles, and this could apply to nearly all our articles here. I tend to acknowledge it in the edit summary when I create the page. Personally, I think that's enough, especially as we have a link to the English version in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Wikipedia%7EInterlanguage_links_c114.html" title="Wikipedia:Interlanguage links">interlanguage links</a> section anyway. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 02:29, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The way I see it, english and simple english are not really separate languages. Therefore, I'd expect articles for the two to be tightly coupled. An example where this is currently not the case is <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement.html" title="Movement">movement (simple)</a>. There are no interlanguage links to <a href="../../../../en/m/o/v/movement_74bc.html" class="extiw" title="en:movement">en:movement</a> and back (Hey, why is that extra colon required in [[:en:movement]], I thought this is not necessary on talk pages?). Would it be possible to automatically link "simple:movement" to "en:movement" and back? Rainer</p>

<p>Hello. Thank you for the good idea of making a Wikipedia in simple English. I am currently working on a new Wikipedia, the Tok Pisin wikipedia. In order to facilitate the work of users-to-come, I am using bilingual frames with English next to Tok Pisin. Whenever there is an article in simple English, I use it rather than the article in English.<br />
But for the article on Buddha, there is no simple English article yet, and the English article is far too complicated. Could you make it more simple, and more explanatory about Buddhism?<br />
Please see:<br />

<dd>Hi, Milaiklainim. I translated the article on Buddha (not a particularly good original imoh) but couldn't see how to get it into the simple wiki. It inserted itself into the normal English version instead. I reverted it, but of course the simple version will be archived if you think you can fish it out and paste it across correctly. Need to keep your eye on the title bar to see which version you are editing! Perhaps the simple version could have a different background tint or something... <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShantavira_6f6b.html" title="User:Shantavira">Shantavira</a> 10:00, 10 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Hello all, thanks for the article on Buddhism and on Buddha. I will use them in the Tok-Pisin Wikipedia (for the moments, links to the Simple Wikipedia are not set, but I will update them soon). I hope the Simple will grow; one reason is that it could well help less-favored languages to find a basis for their Wikipedias.<br />

As for the Simple Wikipedia, here is my comment:maybe a bit too long; I was thinking the other day about the Simple articles that maybe they could have two or three "levels". One very simple, dictionary like, definition (short but as explanatory as possible), one slightly more extended list of relevant points; and then details. All could be on the same page or on different pages. Well, those are only my comments as a non-native speaker of English. Anyway, thanks again! I hope for more cooperation between the Simple and the TP Wikipedias. --160.23.221.3 02:58, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)"</dd>

<p>I think that is a good idea, just there might be trouble regulating it. However it might limit the direct copying from English. Any further comment?<br />

Hello all. I am the non-English-native user who suggested to have (more or less) three levels of simplicity/complexity (see above). It seems that you like the idea. My suggestion now is to work on a <i><b>sample article</b></i> or <i><b>example article</b></i> to try it, and refine it until we have a better idea how it could work.

<dd>Hi everybody; you certainly had many debates about this subject. Nevertheless, I'd like to add my comment as a non-native English speaker about this point.
<dl>
<dd><b>Sentence complexity</b>. I tend to make rather long sentence when I write, but it is only because I am not very good at... simplifying. Nevertheless I understand written English when sentences are short. They are also easier to translate to another language (including in computer-assisted translation), and easier to understand for children. So my suggestion is to try have one phrase sentences rather than multiple-phrase sentences. Exemple: <b>"Earth rotates so each part of it is in light during the day and dark at night"</b> could be something like: <b>"Earth spins. When one face of earth faces the sun, it receives light. That is day. The other side is dark. That is night".</b> (see <a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia%7ESimple_talk_tier_sample_8135.html" title="Wikipedia:Simple talk/tier sample">Wikipedia:Simple_talk/tier_sample</a>)</dd>
<dd><b>Vocabulary</b>. Maybe you could use the 800 some words dictionary of basic English as a guideline. Complex words could be occasionaly used, but with a clarification between brackets, Exemple: <b>"Create your watchlist (a list of the pages you would like to follow)"</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I read somewhere that some of you don't want to give such guidelines, but it seems to me that they can not be avoided. Nevertheless, they could be used only in order to symplify already written pages, in order to let people use their creativity when they right new articles, wirthout having to bother to much about simplicity criteria.

<p>It's just we need to do something about complex articles that are just copied from <i>en</i> also there are ones that have just been written in complex English straight on here.<br />
Some of these articles can be simplified quite easily, but there are others that are too long or far above our understanding. Do we then delete the article? Or do we do something else like placing a MediaWiki notice?<br />
For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>This page is not simple enough, you can help Wikipedia by simplifying it.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>If we go down that route, should we also have a Wikipedia:Needs simplifying page?</p>

<p>I personally think we need to use an established standard for "simple" English, such as Ogden's Basic English. Saying "simple" without specifying HOW simple is like saying in a recipe "Beat the mixture until it's ready" without saying how one can tell when the eggs are "ready". --<a href="../../../../en/n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" class="extiw" title="en:User:Node_ue">Node</a></p>
<p>Very true, and that has been discussed a lot. There are problems with precise definitions though. Mainly the inconvienience stopping people contributing. Also, some subjects cannot be described using only <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_English_33a0.html" title="Basic English">Basic English</a>, so less simple language has to be used - a tiered system has been discussed and seems popular, but involves writing more articles, so takes longer. -- <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 15:32, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insectivore.html" title="Insectivore">Insectivore</a> I began with the easy things at the top. Harder things I put closer to the bottom. The more someone reads, the less simple the ideas are. Ideas that have a higer order of complexity are very close to the bottom. Cross references for further elaboration of the concepts in the text are located at the very end. In this way I hope that a reader may find themselves drawn further into the article if they are able, yet allow someone with lesser language skills to have an 'easy entrance' to the language. So in preference to the 'tier' idea, I have somewhat used a tier system within one article. I'd appreciate some feedback on this article if you have the time.<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 06:06, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We don't seem to have an agreement on a restricted vocabulary. There appears to be a consensus that <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_English_33a0.html" title="Basic English">Basic English</a> by itself is too limited. Also, the approximately 80,000 words understood by a native English adult speaker is too many. A great many of them overlap each other as unnecessary synonyms. I propose we use the <a href="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Simple Wiktionary</a> to attempt to come to a general agreement on the vocabulary. I suggest that the definitions use <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_English_33a0.html" title="Basic English">Basic English</a> and pictures as much as possible. When there is agreement that a word is too complex, its listing should state this and propose an alternate word or phrase to use as a substitution.

<ul>
<li>Vocabulary is not a problem. We should not use big words without a good reason, but most of our readers can always look up strange words in a dictionary. My wife often surprises me when I use a strange word; she says, "I understand." But she has trouble with difficult grammar. It is better to keep grammar simple than to use fewer words. <a href="../../../x/i/o/User%7EXiong_2293.html" title="User:Xiong">Xiong</a> 07:56, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>When I was learning serbo-croat I found the complete opposite. Difficult words made it very hard to read but new grammar was usually no problem. I think sometimes an article needs a difficult word and that's okay as long as it is explained and reapeated. I supect many people will use these pages to learn so the odd difficult word is good so long as it is given a context so people can guess what is meant. <a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejvid_f1a9.html" title="User:Dejvid">Dejvid</a> 7 July 2005 10:12 (UTC)</li>

<p>As of the 22nd May, this wikipedia is the 34th biggest by official article count, however we are 65th in bytes/article. We seem to have got into a habit of writing stubs, and not expanding them.

<dd>Maybe, but I don't think it's a huge problem. I believe it's fairly common for Wikipedias to start this way.

<dd>I make stubs just before bed time. Often they are articles the next time I see them. I think some people make stubs to find out more information. Stubs do not bother me at all if they are good stubs. Stubs are ideas for articles. Stubs are asking for more information. Stubs can hold a place that a bigger article can go in. You can link to a stub. Linking to a stub creates a structure for information. When you link to a stub, you are pointing at it. Some people may follow the link because they want to see what you are pointing at. When they find that it is a stub, that is a chance to add something. If it is a very good stub it will be liked to by many other articles and many people will see the stub. Many people cannot help adding some information to any stub that they find. I like good stubs. They are easier to fix than a long bad article that says things that are not true.<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 06:49, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is my first time on this wiki. I have read the Useful pages and how to edit. I also read the earlier questions here. But I'm still confused about how long or complex articles should be. For example, the "Dog" article in En: wiki is very long; the <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog.html" title="Dog">Dog</a> article here is very short. Is that on purpose? Or is it simply that no one has expanded the one here? It might help transplanted wikipedians like me to have a Good Example of one or two En: articles that you think are well done here. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> 19:18, 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think there needs to be a limited length. An article can be simple but still long. Readability analyses take into account the number of words per sentence, rather than the number of sentences. I expect that one reason pages are still short here is just because we're still a small Wikipedia. It takes a while before people start focusing more on expanding existing articles rather than writing new ones. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 23:50, 17 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How about a system like that at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_of_the_week" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_of_the_week" rel="nofollow">English WP:Article of the week</a>, where a topic is nominated to be a 'focus' for the week. The only problem is that there doesn't seem to be enough editors working here often enough. I think there could be a real push to get English editors to work on Simple. Maybe a campaign to get people who create a new article at the main WP to also create a matching Simple article here? Even if they don't become regulars here, they will have added at least one page. Considering that anyone at the main English WP has the potential to be able to write at the Simple WP, there could be a strong collaboration set up between the two. Instead of Simple being seen as "just another language I don't understand". Prehaps simply getting a prominent list of needed Simple articles at the main WP (Community Portal) could kick start the effort. I need to think through some ideas more closely first, but I wanted to see if anyone else has similar proposals. <a href="../../../t/p/k/User%7ETPK_a8ee.html" title="User:TPK">TPK</a> 06:29, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>As there seems to be no separate page for discussing language questions only, here's how I see the problem of using "book of knowledge" and not "encyclop(a)edia".</p>
<ul>
<li>a book of knowledge could be anything, a religious text, for example, but "encyclopaedia" is only one thing. Children's encyclopaedias are called "books of knowledge" in English, but how should learners of English know that?</li>
<li>if you use a dictionary, you can find exactly what "encyclopaedia" is in your language, but with "book of knowledge", you are not sure. It's like a crossword puzzle but without the crossword grid.</li>
<li>"know" is a difficult verb which often translates as two verbs in other languages (know a fact / know a person).</li>
<li>"Knowledge" also sounds very different in other languages, but "encyclopaedia" sounds nearly the same. Compare:</li>

<p>I see no use in continuing to indent, so I'll just comment here. It seems that none of these has been implemented, or that perhaps another was chosen. I like A, because it is consistent with all of the other Wikipedias. For instance, the text is in the same place, and it says thesame thing. No other language Wikipedias have <i>Free (Language) Encyclopedia</i> because it is evident by what language it is written in, making the <i>English</i> part unnecessary. Also, the text on B is too small. My only question is would it be <i>free simple</i> or <i>simple free</i>. I guess it depends what type of Wikipedia it is. --User:Moogle 1:10pm 2-25-05 (MST)</p>

<p>On English wikipedia you can create new pages by searching for them - if the page doesn't exist there's a link saying "create an article with this title".

<p>I think the attempt to create a simple english version of wikipedia is excellent. Maybe using short sentences is valuable for someone who does not speak english well. Obviously it is very difficult for someone who speaks english natively to create text which is easily understood by someone who doesn't. However, I think there is one important aspect of language simplicity which has not been mentioned -- and that is the use of idioms. If text is created without using very many idioms, it will be much easier for readers to look up words in a dictionary and understand the english text.</p>
<p>Good Luck with this effort.</p>

<p>Hello, I m catalan speaker, i just discovered this simple wikipedia. I had seen it many times before as links but i couldnt understand its purpose until i got here. A wikipedia for non-native english speakers is a great idea. But i think I another one: as many people use (or might use) this wiki to learn, why not have a correction section? Non native will be able to collaborate and then good speakers will correct artcicles. This would have three benefits; 1) it will make simple wikipedia grow 2) it will animate contributors from many parts of the world, so artciles would not be as englishcentric as they are now; it would be the wikipedia of the world, in the most spoken language of the world 3) it will help people to learn</p>
<p>Ah, catalan wikipedia is <a href="http://ca.wikipedia.org" class="external free" title="http://ca.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">http://ca.wikipedia.org</a>. We are trying to make it bigger. We could use a lot of simple articles!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good idea! I really like your suggestions, especially that Wikipedia needs to be less Anglocentric (focused on English-speaking countries). How would a "correction section" be different from regular Simple English articles? Or to think about it a different way, would you feel comfortable adding new content to, let's say, the article on <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalonia.html" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>? (It looks like you could really help there!) If not, what could we do to help you feel more comfortable? Cheers, PhilipR 17:45, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding the use of Disambiguation pages and listings in articles, I've found that alot of people are putting links to confused terms in the 'See Also' sections, rather than the standard Wikipedia style of at the top in italics which I think most find alot easier to use as you can see right away if you are on the wrong page.

<p>Something as simple as we use smaller numbers for temperatures that are colder, and larger numbers for hotter temperatures.

<p>Actually, this is more of a general question in regards to the structure and purpose of this wiki. Is this wiki simply going to consist of the same organizational structure as the English one, but with parallel articles that are simplier in language? Or is this going to form its own structure (one that's also simplier) in terms of templates, categories, articles, etc. If the latter, we need to stop creating massive page dumps like <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. One of the problems with these kinds of pages (beyond the obvious problem of simplification) is that it forces this wiki into a structure (especially since people also copy the category links over) exactly like the English one. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 08:34, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Simple: should be "independent" from en:. The target audience are English learners. We don't want to discourage them with complex structures, pages full with information etc. If they want more info, they could go to en:, or their own language Wikipedia (if there's one). Pages should be created from scratch, not dumped from en:. It's easier for people to add info rather than simplying a complicated article. Further, the articles must be "global", and not anglocentric as en: tends to do.

<dd>Some of the structure, such as the year categories, are so common among all the other Wikipedias that we should follow that approach. Moreover, I suggest that wherever possible we should have our page names match those at the full English Wikipedia. Presumably, any discussions about appropriate names have been handled there,and it makes linking to and from here more intuitive. Obviously, this means that for complex terms, we need to use piped links creatively, by hiding the complex page title behind simpler discriptive words in the article text. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 17:07, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please look at article <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_dragon.html" title="Chinese dragon">Chinese dragon</a> and then look at the source (edit page). I can make one image show up that definitely comes from the media commons (I searched there to find it). But two other images found on the <a href="../../../../en/c/h/i/Chinese_dragon.html" class="extiw" title="en:Chinese_dragon">English wikipedia article</a> for Chinese dragons and elsewhere don't seem to work.</p>
<p>Any ideas why? Are these other images actually stored inside English Wikipedia and can't been referenced from here? <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 04:35, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>that's right. You could just download them from English wiki and upload them back onto this wiki, but I think that's frowned upon as we are now supposed to be switching to using the Commons images. <a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaintswithin_0ea1.html" title="User:Saintswithin">Saintswithin</a> 10:16, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I realize that I won't make any friends by appointing myself grammar <s>cop</s> policeman, so please understand the following as not directed at any individual(s). Also because we're all human and make the occasional typo or slip-up, this point is directed at myself as much as anyone else.</p>
<p>Because this Wikipedia is so useful for English-learners, we all need to make sure we follow standard English (regardless of the regional variant) to set a good model. There are two classes of error (or non-standard form) that seem to recur by my observation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Misuse of <i>it's</i> as the possessive of <i>it</i></li>
<li>Run-on/Comma splice, where two complete sentences are joined by a comma.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure there are others I haven't noticed, so feel free to edit and add to this list. Granted, both of these show up commonly in informal written English by native speakers. I actually believe that the use of "it's" will become standard in a couple more decades (much as "If I was..." for the past subjunctive is considered by many to be standard) because so few people observe the present standard. But AFAICT as a refence work an encyclopedia should use present-day standard written English, not advocate its change. Comments?</p>
<p>Thanks, PhilipR 16:55, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I worry about one part of this: commas and run-on sentences. My wife is a professor of English, and so I am now more careful in how I say things to her and others.&#160;:) But here we have a problem of not only the need to write correct English, but also needing to write English that can be understood.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have written many sentences here, where I have used commas 'wrongly'. I have used commas where some people would pause (stop for a little time) in speaking. Often this is done so that a non-native English speaker can "catch up" with what has been said up to now. Many English sentences can be long (like in German), and it is hard for learners to hear (or read) all the ideas in even one sentence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Instead of trying to write sentences that can be 'models' of perfect (or even good) English, I try to write simple English sentences that can be more easily read.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But this can be seen as wrong in two different ways.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First, a person can learn the wrong English! The language you might hear spoken is not always "correct English". And many people assume that anything written is (or should be) more correct than spoken. So some people might say you should <i>never</i> write bad English, as it is possible a learner might copy the bad English, thinking that it is correct!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, the best simple English is written as 'correct' English, without being too hard to read. But that is very hard to write! So the person writing incorrect English, using commas and run-on sentences, is being lazy?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We want to write the best Simple English. But writing Simple English takes learning and practice, just as reading any kind of English takes learning and practice. I guess that until I can write the best kind, I will contribute what I can, trying to improve, and watch as people change what I have written to be even better.</dd>

<p>Oh, and my "pet peeves" are the mis-use of "your", "you're", and "you". Sometimes I send emails to web page writers saying "You're going to be embarrassed when you reread your writing.", and wonder if they understand what I mean. The other problem I see often is people dropping the 'r' from 'your', as in "I hit you car!". I have even seen people then start dropping the "'re" from "you're", as in "You going to be mad!" (as guess because they sound the same - once you have started doing the wrong thing for one case you can then start doing it wrong in both cases). <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 01:19, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it would be a really good thing for there to be more simple wikipedias. But I think there is a reason why Simple English was created, and other simple wikipedias have not been created.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some people have a lot of pride in their native language, and want people to learn it. For example, I am surprised there is no "Simple French" wikipedia. Other people want their language to still be used, and want to help their children learn the language even when they live in another country. These are good reasons to help people learning, but aren't good enough, it seems.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think the reason that Simple English was created and should improve is because a lot of people <i>must</i> learn English. Not 'must' as though a person says it is the best language forever. But only that in the world today, English is used in more places than many other languages. Today, if you want to talk to someone from some other place in the world, it is very possible that the only language that both of you might know would be English. (At one time French was the language 'everyone' would know, and before that Spanish, which is why I say 'today')</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I wish there was a Simple <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin.html" title="Mandarin">Mandarin</a> wikipedia, and a Simple <a href="../../../g/e/r/German.html" title="German">German</a> wikipedia. But many people <i>want</i> and <i>need</i> a Simple English wikipedia. English is not easy. It is an accident that English is used in so many places today. But since it is so widespread, people need to learn English. We can help them here. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 8 July 2005 04:13 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, shenme. I m not English, I speak catalan. But I think one reason to creat this wikipedia is to be used by other wikipedias to create their own articles (the famous list of 1000 basic articles). Lots of people don't know the existence of this wikipedia, so they go to English one. Advertise you in "Talks" of other wikis, it will be easy for you and useful for everyone.

<dd>First of all, I think that it should be Category:Stubs to be accurate. Secondly, while I agree with Netoholic, let's be realistic. We have way too writers who are creating stubs all over the place. It's just the nature of a wiki. We won't tend to have a number of large articles for a while, I believe. It's not too much work to move them into a category, which will also give us some kind of count of stubs. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 18:22, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> doesn't actually incorporate any images, it may be helpful to modify this website's stylesheet to prevent vandals from adding inappropriate images to that page, as <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERoberto_ed03.html" title="User:Roberto">Roberto</a> recently did, for example. This can be done simply by hiding all images on the Main Page. The following steps require the use of <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_f252.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator">administrative rights</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a rule in <a href="../../../m/o/n/MediaWiki%7EMonobook.css_fb19.html" title="MediaWiki:Monobook.css">MediaWiki:Monobook.css</a> that goes somewhere along the lines of:
<dl>
<dd><code>div.hide-all-img img {display: none&#160;!important}</code></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>At the beginning of <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>, add the following code:
<dl>
<dd><code>&lt;div class="hide-all-img"&gt;</code></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>And at the end, add the following code:
<dl>
<dd><code>&lt;/div&gt;</code></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>

<dd>How do you come up with the idea that we can't use public domain materials? BTW, the bottom of the manythings main page says, "Copyright (C) 1997-2005 by Charles I. Kelly and Lawrence E. Kelly. All Rights Reserved. Copying and uploading material from this web site to another web site or intranet is prohibited.", so they clearly don't allow copying. Is Voice of America a US government agency, or a semi-private entity? If US government, then they are clearly useable. If a semi-private entity, then their statement that all of their material is public domain gives us free right to it. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:53, July 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How do you come up with the idea that the materials in question have come from ""the Manythings" website? Thank for very much for informing me there is a website which reuses materials of Voice of America .</p>
<p>You are one of administrater of this Wikipedia. Then, you should know that works done by US Federal Government can NOT be copyrighted as clarifing States Laws. In the meantime, I will report to Voice of America that her all materials are Copyrighted exclusively by ""the Manythings" website.</p>
<p>I think you should delete the Voice of America Word Book and also others retrieved from VOA website, as long as you defenf copryrights of the Manythings website in question. -- <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_8eae.html" title="User:Green">Green</a> 00:26, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>YOU pointed to the manythings website above. I had never heard of it, until you mentioned it, and I went there and found that copyright. I have no idea what's going on with them or VOA. And I am not an admin on the simple Wikipedia. I am not DEFENDING anything having to do with manythings. You brought it up. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 17:37, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you, RickK. To make it simple, I exlpans again. In the past I uploaded a public domain material here on Sam Cooke from <a href="http://www.voanews.com/specialenglish/Archive/a-2003-01-24-3-1.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.voanews.com/specialenglish/Archive/a-2003-01-24-3-1.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.voanews.com/specialenglish/Archive/a-2003-01-24-3-1.cfm</a> . But it was deleted later by an administrator as saying it was a clear violation of copyrights by Manythings.org. That was a whole story in short. --<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_8eae.html" title="User:Green">Green</a> 01:12, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There’s someone proposing a policy to close some minor, slow-growing, “hopeless” wikipedias on the wikimedia meta-wiki. (see <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposed_policy_for_wiki_closure" class="external autonumber" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposed_policy_for_wiki_closure" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>) This proposal is the enemy to the openness of the whole wikipedia community. I come here to inform you to express your opinion there. I think it's OK to use your own language on the talk page.

<p>I just came across another place where I had a big urge to make a word a link, but <b>not</b> to an 'obvious' definition or related word, but instead to a <i>usage</i> definition.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Type 1 or <i>Insulin Dependent</i> Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) is caused by ...</dd>
</dl>
<p>If someone has been reading English a lot, they are familiar with a writer showing an <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbreviation.html" title="Abbreviation">abbreviation</a> or <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym.html" title="Acronym">acronym</a> next to a long full name, and then using only that short word later in the article. But if someone is not familiar with this, they will wonder what that '(IDDM)' thing is! So I wanted to do this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Type 1 or <i>Insulin Dependent</i> Diabetes Mellitus (<a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym.html" title="Acronym">IDDM</a>) is caused by ...</dd>
</dl>
<p>I linked the word to a definition of how it was being used. The hope is that a confused person will see the definition of acronym, return to the article, look at 'IDDM' and discover that it really is an acronym of the four words before that. Of course, when they have seen this done once, they will know to look for this same 'acronym' thing again. But we are trying to help English learners, and that must include some stylistic or usage examples.</p>
<p>Is this an appropriate thing to do? When can it be done? <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 17:32, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd suggest doing it like this
<dl>
<dd>Type 1 or <i>Insulin Dependent</i> Diabetes Mellitus (<a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym.html" title="Acronym">acronym</a> IDDM) is caused by ...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This prevents the confusion when someone clicks on the letters expecting more information on IDDM. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 19:20, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
