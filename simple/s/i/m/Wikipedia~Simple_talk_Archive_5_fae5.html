<p>I think we should impose a minimum number of edits (say, 50) on anything where there is voting involved. This is to discourage sockpuppetry. What are your opinions? -- <a href="../../../e/p/t/User%7EEptalon_a472.html" title="User:Eptalon">Eptalon</a> 02:49, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That, and a resident checkuser, ought to nip this problem in the bud. Only problem is, we still don't have a checkuser, to say for 100% sure what is going on, although it certainly does look fishy. Anyone who wants to try again for the 25 votes, or nominate someone to, can go right ahead. Of course the 50 edit minimum should apply there too! <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 03:27, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would like a local CheckUser, but I don't want us to over-use it, IP information should be kept private if possible. If it's blatantly obvious what's going on, do we necessarily need a CheckUser? Anyway, I'm still not sure we'd get the 25 votes for a CheckUser in a reasonable amount of time. Although we have had a big increase in the number of regular editors, I still think it would take over a month, which I think is pushing it a little. <i><a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">Archer7</a> - <a href="../../../a/r/c/User_talk%7EArcher7_d9a3.html" title="User talk:Archer7">talk</a></i> 12:33, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are several pages (May 2004) that are variations of the basic year pages (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>).

<p>This week's topic to focus on is 'Buildings and structures'; it has been that since the beginning of March (my fault, I forgot all about it). How about we place that box on the recent changes notice as well as on the community portal?</p>
<p>Also, how about we have a 'current project' at times when there's really big things to get out of the way (eg cleaning up a section of our <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">important articles</a>). If we have these on the recent changes notice, people won't forget about them (at least I won't) and I think we could get massive jobs done incredibly fast. <i><a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">Archer7</a> - <a href="../../../a/r/c/User_talk%7EArcher7_d9a3.html" title="User talk:Archer7">talk</a></i> 12:26, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is generally no minimum imposed, but unless you have been around for some time, and you have done some editing, it will be hard to convince people.

<p>Right now, if we get our "<a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">important articles</a>" looking good, I think we'd be a good encyclopedia. Although we are improving very rapidly right now, and people are now using us for reference, I don't think we're at the point where we can say we're good. Here's a process I suggested we go through with each of our articles a few months ago which I found decaying in the archives with no response, along with a few extra things I thought of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copyrights - no point sorting it out if it has to be deleted anyway</li>
<li>Expansion - unfortunately necessary for almost all articles.</li>
<li>Structure text</li>
<li>Categorise</li>
<li>Fact checking and sourcing. - VERY IMPORTANT</li>
<li>NPOV</li>
<li>Simplify</li>
<li>Check 'tone' - core articles cannot be written in a patronising tone.</li>
<li>Spell check - I recommend Google Toolbar, which checks articles on the 'edit' screen</li>
<li>Link.</li>
<li>Link to sister projects (use EN projects if absolutely necessary)</li>
<li>Images where appropriate (we need a lot more, they're much more important for our target audience)</li>
<li>Skim through for anything you may have missed, check talk page etc for other problems</li>
<li>Post on review page, possibly promote to a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Category%7EVery_good_articles_563a.html" title="Category:Very good articles">very good article</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope to automate a lot of this process through scripts, eg an online spellchecker, readability tests, wordlist lookup tools, and simpler things like direct links to save typing for searching Commons and other projects. I'm not actually sure if I can write that sort of code, but it's an idea. Your opinions please! <i><a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">Archer7</a> - <a href="../../../a/r/c/User_talk%7EArcher7_d9a3.html" title="User talk:Archer7">talk</a></i> 20:58, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here are my points to note:
<ul>
<li>Each article should have at least one outgoing link. This is not counting interwiki links, links to a category, or links resulting from the use of a template (like stub).</li>
<li>Each article should also consist of at least three sentences.</li>
<li>Reduce red links (articles not there yet) in other articles.</li>
<li>Categories are only useful if they contain 3-4 articles, or more. Smaller categories should be combined into bigger ones.</li>
<li>Shorter articles can be merged into bigger ones.</li>

<dd>In case some of you haven't noticed on recent changes, I'm tryng to set up a test of this at <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_Core_article_process_917d.html" title="User:Archer7/Core article process">User:Archer7/Core article process</a> in the form of a 'wizard' type thing. It basically guides you through every step to make a good article, in order (so you don't mess up things you've already sorted) so in theory you can use it on almost any article however bad it is and it'll be good by the time it comes out.

<p>I copied Template:Babel over from English Wikipedia. Now users can write "{{Babel|en|fr-3}}" and have Babel boxes on their user pages to tell people which languages they speak. I did this for Simple English Wiktionary, too. If there is no box for your language, go to English Wikipedia or another Wikipedia and copy it. Copy a page like "Template:User fr-3" from English Wikipedia to Simple English Wikipedia and then there will be a box for your language. To copy, click "edit this page" on English Wikipedia but don't change the page. Use your computer mouse to copy it. If you can't easily copy with a computer mouse, ask someone to do it for you. On Simple English Wikipedia, search for "Template:User fr-3" or the language box you are looking for. If it says there is no page, it will say you can create the page. Create the page and put the computer words from English Wikipedia there.</p>
<p>Template:Babel looks like just words, but really it has computer words to tell the computer how to make boxes. To make Babel boxes work on another Wikipedia, copy "Template:Babel" to the other Wikipedia. (Use "edit this page".) Also copy "Template:User en" and "Template:User en-3" and other templates like that. Then it will work. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 01:25, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've moved this template for two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are two possible deletion methods, not just quick deletion .</li>
<li>QD is shorter (thus more convenient to type) than the word "delete".--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 00:32, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Not entirely true. QD is shorter than delete, but QD is currently redirecting the D template as well, and longer than D. Pages tagged with D are showing a redirect instead of the delete message block.

<dd>Never mind. It was just the one page and an odd template double redirect issue. I redirected Template:D from T:delete to T:QD and T:D seems to be back working as is should.

<p>Is this a good idea? I may make a list of words. I may start with the 1000 most frequent words, and mark the BE850 ones. Then I may make two pages on Wiktionary: one page will not change. The other page people can change, to take a word out of Simple English and put another word in. Then we can work together to make a list of words for Simple English.

<p>I just took a look at Simple English <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/simple:Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikiquote:simple:Main_Page">Wikiquote</a>. I had misunderstood it! It is a worthwhile project! It is not about collecting quotes in Simple English. It is about collecting quotes in English (or maybe other languages?) and explaining them in Simple English. This is a worthwhile project! But there is a proposal to close it down at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects" class="extiw" title="meta:Proposals_for_closing_projects">meta:Proposals for closing projects</a>!</p>
<p>The reason Simple English Wikiquote is worthwhile is that many people may not understand some famous quotes in English and can benefit from Simple English explanations. Some people voting to close it down say that there's no use collecting quotes in Simple English. They just don't even understand that the project is not about collecting quotes in Simple English!</p>
<p>Others say that if someone doesn't understand a quote in English, they should read a translation of it in their own language. They fail to understand two things: first, that there are many people who can read Simple English but can't read any other language (or not well enough to understand translations of those quotes). This includes some children, some adults who can understand ordinary English but are baffled by expressions like "come what come may" or archaic terms in some famous quotes, many deaf people who have difficulty learning to read because their own language has no written form and they can't hear the sounds that make alphabets meaningful; and other people. Also: if someone is learning English, an explanation in Simple English of a famous quote would help them understand the quote without switching back to their own language; switching back can interfere with learning a new language. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 03:08, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are no formal admin elections. If you want to be an administrator, nominate yourself with a short statement on <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a>.

<p>I just nominated myself to be a sysop. I believe we should give vandals one warning, and if the vandaliz again block them for at least 2 weeks, we need to get vandals off wikipedia. If that person vandals again ban him from using wikipedia. If someone is rude give that person a warning, and if he is rude again block him for at least 3 day's, so they can cool down. After the first block every time a person is rude I would block him with no warning. I will protect a user page if that person asks me too.

<dl>
<dd>Sorry, but that just isn't how it works. Admins need to consider all sorts of things when blocking people. Is it a school IP, and are we blocking all the good contributors that edit under an account? Is it a dynamic (changing) IP, so the block will have no effect? Lots of vandals have gone on to become really brilliant users of Wikipedia, and banning after two incidents is too extreme. Also, I think you can't just say that someone is 'rude'. On Wikipedia, we can only communicate via text. This means that we can't tell much about the way people are trying to say things, so people can easily sound rude when in fact they're being quite reasonable. Incivility should never be blocked that harshly anyway. And finally, blocks should not be viewed as a punishment. The 'Block' function is not there to teach people a lesson, it is there to be a technical restriction if people are causing too much trouble to deal with, or need some time to cool off. A ban is also different to a block (see <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBans_and_blocks_702a.html" title="Wikipedia:Bans and blocks">Wikipedia:Bans and blocks</a>). As I said, all this can be learned over time, so keep working for a few more months and then maybe. Right now, I'm afraid I'll have to oppose your nomination.

<p>Now I know how it works and I will be able to do things right. I am a very quick learner and will always ask for the advice of other sysops. When I become a sysop I will ask other sysops how long they think that person should be blocked. I think it is fine to ban someone after 2 blocks, 3 warnings before the first block. --<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_James_Paul_0ceb.html" title="User:Sir James Paul">Sir James Paul</a> 21:40, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand that we are a small project but I still think that we need wikiprojects like on wikipedia. The projects that I think we need are Wikiproject Religion, Wikiproject Science, Wikiproject Politics, and Wikiproject History. The wikiprojects will have members, articles that need to be made, and articles that need to be improved.

<p>I am involved in a couple of WikiProjects on the English Wikipedia. IMHO, the Simple Wikipedia, at this time, does not have the number of users needed to make individual WikiProjects work. There are, however, a number of things that could be considered.</p>
<p>1) Doing Simple Wikipedia-wide collaborations and similar projects (Wikipedia: Collaboration of the Month?). If these work well, then consider doing more focused efforts, such as Wikipedia:WikiProject Science.</p>
<p>2) Consider creating some sort of structure for finding editors with similar subject interests. It could be something like the notice boards on the main English-language Wikipedia, or it could be just categories (with optional Babel-like templates?). )Wikipedia:Science Interest Group and/or Category:This editor likes science?.)</p>
<p>3) Try recruiting some editors from some of the most active WikiProjects on the main English-language Wikipedia for collaborations. You could, for example, identify a core group of articles on animals that need work, and then ask for help from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Tree_of_Life" class="extiw" title="w:Wikipedia:WikiProject_Tree_of_Life">w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Tree of Life</a> (and its numerous subprojects). I would suggest starting off slowly by doing quarterly interwiki collaborations. For three months, you would try to improve important articles on animals, and then for the next three months, it might be articles on countries (recruiting help from editors for the WikiProjects for each country).</p>

<p>This is s serious question - editing this board is very technically difficult especially for light posters, so many rules and things to learn. So how do you manage to stay so polite and helpful in the face of such utter and complete incompetence by the general community of wanna-be editors? Is there a special wiki-college out there where trolls and vandals are trained to be responsible adults and turned into nice admin folk? Does this require brain surgery as well? <a href="../../../e/x/c/User%7EExcalibur_1839.html" title="User:Excalibur">Excalibur</a> 12:26, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess this is not easy to answer. However, what you learn as a person contributing regularly, is that most of the time, people take pride in their edits. They are proud about the articles they wrote, or they helped to make better. Guaranteed, this is a process, and it takes some time to learn. When rules are made, most of them should make sense, and should have the backing of the community. All it takes is time. And for those people that do not want to take this step, and vandalise pages, It takes only a limited number of offenses, until they are completely block. Being civil does not cost much, but it pays in the end. -- <a href="../../../e/p/t/User%7EEptalon_a472.html" title="User:Eptalon">Eptalon</a> 16:31, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When new users come here, they often do not know where to start. Useful things that this wikipedia needs (and that strangely, few people want to do):</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Simplify articles</i>. Make sentences shorter. Replace difficult words with easier ones.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Cleanup articles</i>. Make sections with headings, use some markup. Also each article should have at least one interwiki link, and one outgoing link (to somewhere else in this Wikipedia). Quite a few articles do not.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Extend existing articles</i>. If you do not know much about the subject, look it up in another Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Users cannot delete vandalised articles</i>. In some cases, valid subjects are vandalised.I recently saw and deleted a <i>Frederick the Great</i> vandal page. Normal users could simply fight the vandalism by replacing the page with a stub about <a href="../../../../en/f/r/e/Frederick_II_of_Prussia_4cf3.html" class="extiw" title="en:Frederick_II_of_Prussia">en:Frederick II of Prussia</a>.

<p><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">User:Netoholic</a> was the one who decided that policy a while back, when he was bureaucrat. I guess he didn't have time to do all the licensing tasks and checking, and no one else has ever volunteered to do them either.

<p>I would really like to beef up the science portion of this wikipedia but suck at organising myself, and have no idea what "core" topics should be done first. It would be nice if I could get some people to work with me on this and give feedback on where we should focus. I also think some of the science pages though simply written for the sake of language, are too simple to clearly give an impression of the topic they are talking about. Simple doesn't have to mean stupid! The only page I've had a go at is <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_fusion.html" title="Nuclear fusion">Nuclear_fusion</a> and I have no idea if this is the correct level of English to use or accurate enough to give an impression of the true science&#160;:&lt; Anyone who is allready working on science articles on here that wants to boss someone around and see their own goals met, please just leave me some talk on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MattOates" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MattOates" rel="nofollow">my en.wikipedia talk page</a> hope to hear from you lovely people! <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattOates_2c61.html" title="User:MattOates">MattOates</a> 22:59, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can we/ should we (in is it technically possible, and morally feasible) block the uploading of any content? - I deleted about 45 image uploads yesterday; all of them were also in commons.

<p>Hello Community.</p>
<p>The article on <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_emergency.html" title="Medical emergency">Medical emergency</a> used to have a list in it, on what to do in the case of such an emergency<a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_emergency&amp;oldid=274675" class="external autonumber" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_emergency&amp;oldid=274675" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

A revert of mine <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_emergency&amp;curid=25253&amp;diff=274894&amp;oldid=274687" class="external autonumber" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_emergency&amp;curid=25253&amp;diff=274894&amp;oldid=274687" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> caused a dilemma. Please also see <a href="../../../m/e/d/Talk%7EMedical_emergency_939b.html" title="Talk:Medical emergency">Talk:Medical emergency</a>. While such a policy is good in many cases, I can see it doing only harm here. There are situations, where a fast reaction is important (<a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_attack.html" title="Heart attack">Heart attack</a> is another such example). In my opionon, it should be discussed, what policies from (any/en) wikipedia to apply here. If they are to be applied, they should be moved over; and clearly marked as applying. En wikipedia has about 100-150 times as many articles, as this project. It is clear that in a bigger project more rules are needed than in a smaller one.</p>
<p>A last thing. While this item is being discussed, please do not edit/revert such pages as to take out/put in the information. It fills up the edit log, and is much easier to do once a decision has been reached.</p>

<dd>We can't opt-out of that policy. That is there to protect Wikimedia from potential legal action. It's mainly to protect from "HowTo:Do brain surgery, the probably inaccurate guide", but it's something we <b>have</b> to stick by. Looking at it the other way, is the advice you have given strictly medical advice, or is it common sense practices?

<p>I was wondering how to create a redirect page. Specifically, I'd like to redirect <a href="../../../d/i/s/District_of_Columbia_9454.html" title="District of Columbia">District of Columbia</a> to <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>. This would be really helpful to know since so many pages are still blank.
