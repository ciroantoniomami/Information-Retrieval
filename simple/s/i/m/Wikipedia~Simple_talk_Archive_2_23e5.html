<p>What the purpose of this wikipedia? I am a native Russian speaker, and I cant say this "simple English" any bit easier for me than the conventional English. I even cant get the difference.--213.141.159.52 06:27, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps the articles were not well-written. One needs more skill to write an an article in simple language.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some people write in Wikipedia because they want their writing to be seen by other people. But perhaps they forget why the Simple English Wikipedia was started. In the Simple English Wikipedia, style and clarity are the most important things.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Writing here is difficult. But I will try to keep my articles simple and easy-to-read.</dd>

<p>First of all, I archived this. It hasn't been changed in almost a week. I'm new to this wikipedia. I'm from English, and came here to help out, because I think it's a good project. Apparently a lot of people don't think that, and somehow they consider this a constructed language. So, are talk messages supposed to be simple also? --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_d326.html" title="User:Phroziac">Phroziac</a> 16:56, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia%7ESimple_talk_Archive_2_23e5.html" title="Edit section: Suggestion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Suggestion</span></h2>
<p>How about adding a link to <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random" class="external free" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random" rel="nofollow">http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random</a> in the navigation box like in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org</a>?</p>
<p>Is there an online Simple English text inspector?</p>
<p>In the (now archived) Talk page someone asked a question in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. TPK asked if we could have a <i>Featured Article of the Week</i>. Another person said there were not enough good and <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple.html" title="Simple">simple</a> pages to have that. (There was not enough for a new one every week.)</p>
<p>But there is a problem with this wikipedia. If people read SimpleEnglish to learn English it is hard to find <i>good</i> and <i>simple</i> pages. If people browse or click <i>Show any page</i> they might find unsimple pages. They might find pages that are too short or too long. They might find pages that are not fun to read. They might find pages that <i>just suck</i>.&#160;;)</p>
<p>Maybe we should have a place on the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> that says: here are some good and simple articles to read. Then people who are learning English will find them better.</p>
<p>I want to say one more thing. I learned something <i>very</i> good by writing for Simple English. I talk to many people in my job that do not speak good <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a>. I have only been writing for Simple English since May <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. But now if I talk to people who do not know much English, I do better. I write Simple English, but now I can <i>talk</i> simple too! I think about <i>how</i> I say things. I also see better what words are unsimple. It makes my job <i>much</i> easier. Since I am a doctor, it lets me help people more too. So thanks!</p>

<dd>-The public library, and the reference librarians in it, are your friends. You will study a host of Useful Subjects in school, mostly worthwhile. But you may not learn such important but non-academic skills as troubleshooting a running toilet, managing household finances, selecting a profession, getting a well-paying job in that profession, dealing with problematic landlords/roommates/employers, managing your own scarce time, money, and resources, etc. The library (and also now the Internet) have many fine works that can help you navigate such treacherous terrain expertly, and the best news is that it's free, as long as you keep an eye on the calendar. The library also offers some very cheap entertainment, including books, music, movies, and events. In addition, more libraries have started to offer free classes and workshops, Internet connections, and other services.</dd>

<p>And I think simple English is better here, Prozac.<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 00:28, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok. But, remember that most encyclopedia articles are about complicated things, which can't be made too much shorter without removing information. I completely agree with your main page suggestion. And, about the people that you work with who do not speak english well, that is neat. --Prozac</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Prozac, writing for SimpleEnglish doesn't mean you cannot discuss difficult subjects. It just means that you have to word your articles simply and use a limited set of words found in (preferably) <a href="../../../b/e/_/BE_850_893b.html" title="BE 850">BE 850</a>, but also <a href="../../../b/e/_/BE_1500_3318.html" title="BE 1500">BE 1500</a>. Alternatively, you can use an unsimple word as long as you define it for your readers. Its important to understand that the simple English readers may be intelligent people who can grasp difficult ideas and who may bring significant prior knowledge to the table when reading Wikipedia. They may be physicians, educators, and engineers. They just don't have an excellent grasp of English, so you need to use simple English so you can be adequately understood. Some readers may not be as knowledgeable, but they can read simple English, and may learn more if you use Simple English.</dd>
<dd>This requires though that you have to carefully consider how you compose. Its more difficult for me to write in simple English than standard English because I tend to use <i>Big Words</i> and longer sentences. But I have found that if one uses Simple English, it gets less difficult. You learn to say things with less complex sentences and using the limited vocabulary of <a href="../../../b/e/_/BE_850_893b.html" title="BE 850">BE 850</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Or in Simple</b></dd>
<dd>Prozac, Simple does not mean short. Simple does not mean you cannot talk about hard things. It just means you must use simple ways to <i>say</i> things. It also means that you cannot use many big words. You should use words in <a href="../../../b/e/_/BE_850_893b.html" title="BE 850">BE 850</a>. You can use some words in <a href="../../../b/e/_/BE_1500_3318.html" title="BE 1500">BE 1500</a>. Or you can use an unsimple word if you tell people what it means.</dd>
<dd>This is important to see. People who read Simple English may be <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor.html" title="Doctor">doctors</a>, or <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teacher.html" title="Teacher">teachers</a>, or <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineer.html" title="Engineer">engineers</a>. They can be very clever. So they can understand hard things. They can have much knowledge before they read Wikipedia. But they do not <a href="../../../u/n/d/Understanding.html" title="Understanding">understand</a> English well. You must use Simple English so they understand you. Some people who read may not be clever. They may not have much knowledge. But they can read Simple English. They can learn more if you use Simple English.</dd>
<dd>So you have to think hard about what you say. It is harder for me to write Simple English than English. (I like to use big words. I like to put <i>many</i> words together.) But if you use Simple English it gets less hard. You learn the words in <a href="../../../b/e/_/BE_850_893b.html" title="BE 850">BE 850</a> when you use them. You learn how to write less words together. You learn how to use <a href="../../../b/e/_/BE_850_893b.html" title="BE 850">BE 850</a> to say things.<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 05:14, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Someone should create a tool that will examine a document for Simple English. The tool would tell you if any words are not in <a href="../../../b/e/_/BE_850_893b.html" title="BE 850">BE 850</a>. --JoeRepublic 23:12, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's been mentioned above. I agree.

<p>I hate it when people simply copy things over (with red-linked categories and articles) without simplifying at all. It just create more work for everybody else. I've spent way too much time already removing unsimple versions of templates that we already have but am left with a few. Does any feel that <a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">Template:Unreferenced</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikify_3cf0.html" title="Template:Wikify">Template:Wikify</a> are needed? At the very least, they are not simplified at all. If so, we need to create categories (with simple names) and proceed from there.

<ul>
<li>I copied them over because just having one template for "cleanup" is not specific enough. Simple has a ton of articles that need links and layout (wikify), sources cited (unreferenced). Admittedly I did not get around to simplifying the stuff I copied over but I think it is necessary to have it. 65.31.115.145 01:32, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think Ricky81682 is correct we need stubs so people are work on articles that interest them more easily. I make a few category stub with pretty pictures, for articles of which there are a lot of that particular type, for instance Television. Also created medical stub {{med-stub}} for use by medicine articles. I am not creating stubs yet for categories of which there are few articles. But I will go and put things into the proper stub category as I am doing. 216.56.27.87 19:47, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Using DPL, I think we could have all stubs in Category:Stubs and, instead of the stub sub-category pages, use DPL pages of interest (say Category:Music and Category:Stubs) and Users could create their own specialised DPL lists on their user page (say Category:Los Angeles and Category:Death rock and Category:Stubs).

<dd>Well, Category:Stubs has been created. Note that only newer stubs (or stub articles which had now been edited) will show up there, so it's a little empty.

Give them categories so that it's simplier to go through and make those part of the stub system, or remove them completely? I can't imagine keeping them without categories as they will make it difficult to find. Also, <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_c546.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages">Wikipedia:Template messages</a> needs to either link to a single page for stub categories or, if we remove them all, remove them all. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 05:15, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hate stub-sorting with a passion. Even the Category:Stubs is frankly useless because the vast majority of people <i>just don't edit that way</i>. They instead find an article they are interested in and update it. They click a link, and do it again. They do not drill into obscure categories looking for things to improve. It is a phenomenal waste of editing effort to do any work sorting stubs. I consider that sort of task busy-work by editors who don't seem to be able to expand articles themselves. The real workers here have no use of such a system. Please use a simple, one-line stub message, if needed, but don't make it into a project. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 20:29, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What the hell?!? Just because you don't like stubs, you go against everyone else opinion and delete all stubs and also delete all categories? I was putting into stubs to be expanded on, and then expanding the articles, because it is easy that way to keep track of articled need expanding! I am not only person who likes stub categories to help edit articles that need to be longer. I know you are administrator but that does not mean you do not have to listen to what other people want and that does not mean you can just go delete whatever you want without discussion. Maybe all us other editors should just leave and let you run your wiki-kingdom in peace. What are you going to do, ban me now for make my opinion known? 216.56.27.87 22:41, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Net, I have to agree with this user. You can't simply respond with a "I think it's wrong and no one else here is allowed to disagree with me" attitude around here.

<dd>I'd rather see us delete stubs than have people waste a bunch of time sorting them.

<p>Do we have a policy on eras? My personal preference is for BCE. On en Wiki a duel policy is the only workable one but I think we need to decide on one and stick to it even if that should be BC.82.44.21.216 01:59, 5 September 2005 (UTC) I forgot to log in when I signed.<a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejvid_f1a9.html" title="User:Dejvid">Dejvid</a> 00:26, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that BCE and CE are better terms, because they are more general and not tied to Christianity (the guy who made BC/AD didn't even have the right year, since we now know that Jesus was born about 4 BC!). I think we should use them, and I agree that whichever we use, one standard format should be enough. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 21:14, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think BCE and CE are even more pov terms, because they assume that dating years from Christ is or should be "Common Era" to all countries, even the ones that have different dating systems. At least, BC is honest about what it means. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 23:17, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point, Blockinblox. I never thought of it that way. However, using (for example) the Chinese calendar on articles regarding China, while being more consistent and in a way logical, would be very confusing and not very helpful to the majority of users, I would think, especially those who are not familiar with the Chinese calendar system. I think here, also, we should stick by the rule of least astonishment. Maybe listing both the Chinese calendar year and the BCE/CE year (or BC/AD, if that's what we decide) is the best solution. What do you think?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, I understood that the terms "Common Era" and "Before Common Era" were created by Jews to avoid references to Jesus/Christianity. Because of that history, I assumed that it was a term that could be more generally used without offending anyone or pushing a particular POV.

<dd>I think that is important. But I think the best way is for people to look at it <i>in</i> themselves. I know what some of my biases are.

I am a <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">transgender</a> man. So I write about what I know about. But I also try to write things I know about <i>that are important to other people</i>. I have only seen malaria a few times. Doctors in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> have seen it many <i>many</i> times. <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">Malaria</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/o/Cholera.html" title="Cholera">Cholera</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>, and <a href="../../../e/b/o/Ebola.html" title="Ebola">Ebola</a> are important to doctors and people in Africa.

<dd>The bias issue isn't so much about the nature of peoples articles (after all, as said above, people write about whatever they feel confident to contribute about), but more that when such articles are written, they are written with bias. This is what the countering systemic bias issue is. For example, if I think I know a lot about the issue of the "fire station equipment" and write up an article from new on it, if I write only about equipment as known in the USA (assuming that I am American, which I am not), then I ignore other variations of equipment in the developed world, and also the issue of what equipment may be used in less developed countries; and this also ignores the equipment that might be in fire stations in other areas of the world where the duties of the personnel are different to those that I am familiar with. This is solely one example of the bias.--<a href="../../../j/r/l/User%7EJrleighton_92ca.html" title="User:Jrleighton">Jrleighton</a> 01:46, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have recently joined wikipedia simple english and there is one thing i noticed which is really lacking. History! I am currently a high school student in Advanced European History. I am also currently learning German and i am finding the best way to learn german is by reading history. I think That if people trying to learn English saw their history and knew their history, it would be easier for them to understand the article and to learn some more English. I am a very avid reader of history and would love to see some more.

<p>I want to say something about the fragment "From Wikipedia, a free encyclopedia written in simple English for easy reading", which is on the every page of Simple English Wikipedia. I think that "for easy reading" should be omitted.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<pre>
 1) It is clear for everyone without saying.
 2) Simple English Wikipedia can be used not only for easy reading. Some other examples of 
    using of Simple English Wikipedia: 
        a) for translation;
        b) for creating of better complex articles, as Simple Wikipedia issues are brief and
           represent general outline;
        c) as material for teaching children or people with limited knowledge of English;
        d) for studying of difficult subjects (e.g. Mathematics, Physics), even if you
           do not have any problems with English;
        e) for learning in general and for learning of English (while studying or researching
           something, especially complex subjects, it is useful for better understanding and
           absorbing to write the outline of the information down in simple words by our own).

"<i>Simple English uses fewer words and easier grammar than the original English Wikipedia. This is not its only difference. It is focused on readers who tend to be quite different people with different needs: students, children, adults with learning difficulties, and translators.</i>" <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrivate_Butcher_b511.html" title="User:Private Butcher"><font color="black">Private</font></a> <a href="../../../p/r/i/User_talk%7EPrivate_Butcher_faca.html" title="User talk:Private Butcher"><font color="brown">Butcher</font></a> 15:41, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Out of interest, why should translators need to use Simple English? The quote above gives the impression that translators, like children and people with learning difficulties, may need to have articles simplified.

<p><a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Disambiguation</a> is a very complex word for use on the Simple Wikipedia (e.g. <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orlando_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Orlando (disambiguation)">Orlando (disambiguation)</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_%28disambiguation%29_0568.html" title="New York (disambiguation)">New York (disambiguation)</a>). There was a small discussion about changing things roughly a year ago at <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia_talk%7EDisambiguation_d461.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Disambiguation">Wikipedia talk:Disambiguation</a>, but nothing much came of that discussion. I think that the word should not be used at all on the Simple Wikipedia, either in article titles, or in the disambiguation template.</p>
<p>For some words or phrases, a single usage is so predominate that it makes sense to have that usage as the direct link for that word or phrase (<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, possibly). In most cases, however, I think that it would be much better for the Simple Wikipedia to have the primary link go to the disambiguation page (like the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury.html" title="Mercury">Mercury</a> page), with each separate use getting a more specific identification (e.g. <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_%28planet%29.html" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury (planet)</a>). That should keep the number of pages that require a disambiguation tag to a minimum. Those pages that do require a disambiguation tag should be called something like [New York (other meanings)] or [New York (other pages)], instead of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_%28disambiguation%29_0568.html" title="New York (disambiguation)">New York (disambiguation)</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisambig_6efb.html" title="Template:Disambig">template:disambig</a> also needs to be rewritten and simplified.

<p>I am a native Russian speaker and your "Simple English" does not seem any bit easier for me. I even cant get the difference. And what the purpose of these stupid comments on the main page for such international words as biology, geography, architecture and so on? These words are understandable for anybody. I think if a person can understand this wikipedia, he of course will understand the conventional English one. Most difficulty in learning English is not international words, but English-specific ones and grammar. For example, understanding the word <i>people</i> is more difficult than <i>anthropology</i>. If you learn Russian, what would be more easy for you - <i>antropologia</i> or <i>nauka o ludiakh</i>? --213.141.159.52 23:53, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Simple isn't really intended to teach English, but to be readable by people with a limited English vocabulary (1-2,000 words), versus 30-50,000 (or more) word vocabularies. Since the Latin roots are used in science in so many languages, even ones not otherwise related to Latin, those words are indeed recognizable from many other languages. The difference is more in things like "J.K. Rowling is an author of juvenile novels" versus "J.K. Rowling is a writer of fictional children's books." Or "The museum has more than 20 planes and helicopters on display, most of which are in airworthy condition." versus "The museum has more than 20 planes and helicopters to see, most of which can still fly."</dd>

Because English has so many synonyms, homonyms, and borrowed words, the Latin roots can also sometimes be misleading. For example, in "Sharing a rofom with two people whose interests also gravitated towards acting (Shoban Babu and Murali Mohan),..." the meaning of 'gravitated' is pretty far removed from the basic scientific concept of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> (also compare that Simple article to <a href="../../../../en/g/r/a/gravity_67f2.html" class="extiw" title="en:gravity">en:gravity</a>).</dd>

<dd>Not to be overly negative, but I think the whole idea behind this is pretty futile, and I wonder how it got greenlit. I can understand the idea behind creating this wiki, but it seems like a mostly pointless endeavour. en Wikipedia itself has a lot of worthwhile contributors, but even with the amount of people working day and night on that project, it still can never come close to be completely thorough. What makes you guys think that enough people who are intelligent, concise, and clear will devote their knowledge and expertise for essentially dumbing down the language of the content of the regular English wikipedia? I can't really imagine this "translation" becoming comprehensive enough on any subject to really be of any use to anybody. But, if you're dedicated to this project, I'm not going to try to dissuade you... I just recently heard of it and I was wondering exactly what was going on.--69.113.219.173 10:49, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with the "translation" concept, and believe a lot of articles would be better served rewritten from scratch. In addition, taking relatively unchanged EN articles and moving them to SIMPLE (as has happened) with the intention of fixing them later is just going to frighten people off. It will force them to wade through lots of articles to find those which are truly 'simple'.</dd>
<dd>For this reason, I consider overly detailed non-simple articles worse than nothing. (If someone wants an EN article, they can read EN; this is the SIMPLE English Wikipedia). Where I come across articles that are either unsuitable 'dumps' of EN articles or have simply not been written in SIMPLE English, I will likely replace them with a properly-written stub for this reason. EN would not consider quarter-translated Chinese articles acceptable; mixing simple and non-simple English is worse than this because the boundary is less obvious.</dd>
<dd>Remember; half-done "top-down" translations are bad, unlikely to be fixed in a hurry and are often a flawed approach. Either write a proper SIMPLE article from scratch, translate properly with the target audience in mind, or don't do it at all. Less is more. EN should remember that sometimes, but it applies twentyfold here.</dd>

<dd>One of the first things I saw after finding this wikipedia was a debate over what was being called "the condescending factor", and that has stuck in my mind ever since, because a lot of the articles here do suffer from that, it's perhaps the number one biggest black mark on this wiki that draws the most complaints, and I am doing what I can to fix it. Remember, Simple equals "concise" and "clear" - but it does not equal "condescending". Don't write stuff like you think the reader is a total idiot. It should be an easy thing to apply a form of "the Golden Rule" here - <b>Don't write anything that you wouldn't want to read yourself.</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 13:08, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure; I should have been clearer. The audience I have in mind are neither idiots, nor (specifically) children. One of the articles I worked on shortly *before* I wrote the comment above was <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fermat%27s_last_theorem.html" title="Fermat's last theorem">Fermat's last theorem</a>. I'd planned writing this myself, and found it had already been done. Unfortunately, this was an import from EN, and had only received minor modifications. So I have rewritten it from scratch.</dd>
<dd>Yes, it's short, and I could have included more whilst sticking mostly to BE 1500. Why didn't I? Because writing in S.E. is hard work and takes time. Also, I wanted feedback and help from another user (who had also expressed interest in working on it). You'll note from <a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">User_talk:Flcelloguy</a> that my concern was to produce something that was *interesting* to read.</dd>
<dd>My point is that this was not an obvious or "condescending" article choice like "my first reading book". I assumed that the audience had a good level of intelligence and a diverse range of interests, and that the only difference between them and me was that they had less English. Not everyone will like the Fermat article, but I hope that has nothing to do with the writing quality.</dd>
<dd>I agree with you totally though; it's all too easy to be condescending. Trying not to be is something that we should all strive for (myself included). <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 22:53, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This Wiki is a nice idea, however, I would encourage anyone who would like to learn English to challenge themselves by exploring the EN Wiki. The best way to handle the issue of teaching someone english is to create a Wiki called "Wikipedia for those who want to learn English" or something like that, and developing a series of lessons that teach English. Additionally, the place can serve as a resource for people willing to learn, and wishing to discuss and understand topics that already exist on the EN Wiki. The creators of the Simple English Wiki may be solving a problem that does not exist. --Anonymous (2/9/06)</p>

<p>The whole situation has been complicated completely unnecessarily, with server-wasting redirs involved. GNU (disambiguation) has been created, but it will never be reached unless the exact term is searched for (highly unlikely), or the new dab header at <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wildebeest.html" title="Wildebeest">wildebeest</a> is clicked, and since the OS is the only other choice at the dab page, the newly disambig'd title GNU (acronym) is also unnecessary (and would be better as GNU (operating system) or somesuch if it <i>was</i> necessary), so it would be better/faster/more efficient if the dab header there just offered a direct link to the OS. Can an admin please move things back to the nice, simple, efficient <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_b7e8.html" title="GNU">GNU</a>/<a href="../../../g/n/u/Gnu.html" title="Gnu">gnu</a> (sans all parentheticals) structure that it was (and that EN uses)?

<p>_ _ I'm an editor &amp; admin on en:, and the predominant contributor to the <i>structure</i> of en:'s "List of people by name". In that role i also do a lot of editing of the descriptions at the end of each entry, largely to effect what i have lately been calling "low-resolution" causes of notability. (To take some extreme cases, people are sometimes described using "judoka" or "Taoiseach", which IMO are sometimes sources of worry, to those seeking adjacent entries, that they are slipping over the bio they seek, and almost always pointless visual and mental distractions, since the people they are used to describe can be distinguished from the similar names with a few <i>familiar</i> words. At present,i would replace the former by "martial-arts practitioner" and the latter by "Irish politician" -- unless two people of the same name meet the respective description.) What brought me here is the thot that paralleling some vocabulary list here (it turns out to be <a href="../../../b/e/_/BE_1500_3318.html" title="BE 1500">BE 1500</a>) might be a useful standard or discipline in that effort.<br />
_ _ More interestingly, i note that the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_name.html" title="List of people by name">List of people by name</a> here is seriously "under-stocked" and under-structured. E.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first page i looked at (don't know how typical) was <a href="../../../n/_/_/List_of_people_by_name%7E_N_31ef.html" title="List of people by name: N">List of people by name: N</a>, whose content is the essentially that of a section of an en: page, "List of people by name: No#Nov"; the only spot of blue on it is a non-bio lk used to describe a musician (one i haven't gotten around to stripping out of the en: version, namely <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana (band)</a>).</li>
<li>The "List of people by name: J" page, on the other hand, does not seem limited to a short range; with the inter-page index at the top discarded, it bulks 2.5 kB. Combining all the pages subordinate to the en: List of people by name: J shows that it bulks 64 kB. The overhead in the en: version from section headings is surely under 10% and probably more like 2%, so we can infer that there are over 20 times the names on the en: J portion.</li>
<li>I don't see a high red-lk rate on simple: as a problem; to me they are a sign of intended work for the future, and, if nothing else, would serve as simple-vocab guide to what is probably available on en: and might be worth laborious inspection, or a request for someone to reword it for use on simple.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
This suggests to me porting the en: list, and its infrastructure templates, onto simple. As i've already suggested, and "2." below will flesh out some, i have an interest in simplifying the descriptions anyway, so this would not be a straight dump job that the existing editors here would have to clean up or tolerate. It would also give simple: the benefit of the extensive LoPbN structural innovations over about the last 3 years, which make the entries much more accessible and IMO more likely to be used. Offhand, i would suggest that each existing en: entry should be copied into its natural place in the en: list, for a side-by-side comparison, and the redundant line discarded, or the two merged, before making any change on simple:. (Where an en: description is unsuitable for simple:, it may make sense to build both descriptions into a single template transclusion, that would display the one appropriate to whichever of these two Wikipedia sub-sites it appears on; i won't describe now how to accomplish that. Suffice it to say that it would simplify joint maintenance between simple: and en:.)<br />
_ _ I'd appreciate two kinds of response:</p>
<ol>
<li>Would it be an improvement, as it seems to me, for simple: to have an LoPbN with the same number of entries and the same structure (of pages, sections, and bullet headings) as the en: one?</li>
<li>I am inclined in any case to come up with a restricted list of sources of notability for en: LoPbN, but i haven't yet studied the BE 1500 list. Are the <i>concepts</i> there, in your experience, likely to be suitable for distinguishing why subjects of bio articles rate them; i emphasize concepts rather than words, bcz <i>for en:</i> i would expect to continue using "politician" rather than "political policy maker", or whatever is worked up for simple:.</li>
</ol>

<dd>_ _ Thanks. I'm not sure either. I see that there are only a handful of bios on the Requested articles page, and the LoPbN pages i checked certainly seem to be dump-jobs that no one has seen any significant need to improve. One could argue that a heavily red list of names is still valuable by showing which, among the small number of bios, a user is having trouble finding bcz of misspelling, and which are truly missing, whether regretably or bcz they are not needed. But at this point, beating LoPbN into shape would be a big effort compared to the likely utility even if that arguement were a good one.</dd>
<dd>_ _ I do think a less disfunctional letter-A section speaks better for simple: as a whole, so the effort doesn't feel wasted. But i shan't carry that work further unless the interest in bios picks up.<br />

<dd>While it is true that there is currently not much emphasis on biographies here, please note that the above version of Simple English Wikipedia's mission is Netoholic's own version, which he/she has propagated on as many pages as possible, including policy pages (see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> for an example).

<p>Is there a list of articles that have been d i r e c t l y translated from the Simple English Wikipedia into other languages or vice versa? I teach a translation class and know that this would be very helpful for my students. I am particularly interested in translations of/from articles from the German Wikipedia.</p>
<p>If not, are there any public resources online that address this need?<br />

<dl>
<dd>_ _ If you find a source, leave another message on this page, under this heading (click on the "[edit]" link to the right of the heading, and we'll figure out a good place to put the list. (The answer may not be any place on this Wikipedia, but I'd bet that the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia_Foundation_83d9.html" title="Wikimedia Foundation">Wikimedia Foundation</a> would want to support the concept. I picture starting with a Wiki called, say WikiGerman, if your largest group of students are native German- or English speaking ones, studying the other language; it would provide them both with exemplars of translating simple English into simple German. The simple: article and the German translation might be in parallel columns, and footnotes might be added discussing non-obvious translations. Or three views of each article: English-only and German-only, for translating from, and parallel for comparing your result with the currently best translation. Would it work well to tune both the German and English version until they also work as examplars of translating in the opposite direction? If it turns out to, the logical step would be to take the German and Spanish translations of the same article, and tune them until they become exemplars for teaching Austrians and Argentinians each the others group's language. (Let's worry about what to name <i>that</i> wiki when it's needed. [wink])</dd>
<dd>_ _ IMO, the 2 biggest stumbling blocks to making the server a Wiki would be the relative rarity of bilingual editors, and the difficulty of self-evaluating 2nd-language competence. On the other hand, Wikis give up from the start on any thought of optimizing efficiency, and enough translators of various competence levels get involved we might be surprised at the validation procedures they'd work up.</dd>
<dd>_ _ In a sense that is what leads me to my next question for you: is there a pedagogical model where this gets <i>built</i> by the students with their instructors' help? Beginning students study existing exemplars, and choose articles that interest them to translate. Advanced students help the instructors monitor the beginners' recent work, and take on improving suites of related articles and tuning the English articles so they are better translations of good German ones, classes discuss results and problems, and the stock and quality of translations grows steadily. At some point, it becomes useful to compare the original simple: text and the tuned English translation, and see why a good-back translation of a good translation won't always match the original.<br />

<p>I've noticed several sets of articles that seem to be referring to the same thing, so they should probably be merged, and in some cases moved. I don't have much familiarity with these subjects, so before I start slapping {move} and {merge} notes based on my guesses, I thot I'd check here to see if others have a better idea of how these things should actually me taken care of (since I started this list, I've also added some issues that don't involve duplication):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> seem to be describing the same thing (ie, their EN iw links are to the same target). Is there any reason why they shouldn't be merged, and, if so, is there any reason to not match EN by merging them to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>?</li>
</ul>

<li>Three articles (<a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury.html" title="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury%2C_Kent_c7f2.html" title="Canterbury, Kent">Canterbury, Kent</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury%2C_England_4c9d.html" title="Canterbury, England">Canterbury, England</a>) appear to actually be referring to two places, which EN refers to as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury.html" title="Canterbury">Canterbury</a> and City of Canterbury. Anybody have any good ideas about whether we should match EN titles, and which ones of the three should be merged, and to which title(s) they should be moved to?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Are <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_f56f.html" title="Football World Cup">Football World Cup</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_World_Cup_e470.html" title="FIFA World Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> different, or should they be merged? On EN the former redirs to the latter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Template:West Indies (which I think would be better named Template:Caribbean), Template:North America, and Template:Caricom seem heavily overlapped. Is there any reason we couldn't cut them down to two, or maybe even one, template that is more multipurpose (without getting obscenely huge, of course)?</li>

The question, of course, is which direction. Unless Simple has some policy to use 'simplified' Cat names, it seems like everything from Cat:Lang should be moved to Cat:Ling., as being more 'accurate' (and consistent with EN). Otherwise, vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On a related subject, should it be Category:Kings and Queens or Category:Monarchs. The former is more 'simple', but the latter has advantages as well (more easily includes other royalty titles such as 'prince' and 'princess', etc., among other things). Which I guess suggests Category:Royalty should be considered as an option. K&amp;Q is the current usage, and has been used a lot, but that shouldn't really effect our choice, as that could easily be fixed by a bot.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Seems like it would be more consistent with other US titles/cats/templates/etc. if Category:Actors from American was changed to Category:Actors from the United States (EG <a href="../../../p/r/e/Category%7EPresidents_of_the_United_States_5120.html" title="Category:Presidents of the United States">Category:Presidents of the United States</a>).

<li>Many lists were copied from EN in May-July 2004<a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=218.190.30.243" class="external autonumber" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=218.190.30.243" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I haven't reviewed them all, but some were in pretty sorry shape on EN at the time (EG List of coins--not only has much been added, even the grouping/page structure has changed). Now, I do believe that current, accurate lists can be <b>very beneficial</b> in providing people an easy way to determine what articles are missing. But List of coins hardly meets that threshold, and I'd probably lean towards just deleting it. And if someone wants to port more current equivalent lists here, fine (using the new naming/grouping structure). World currency seems like a core topic to me, even if not one of the highest priority, but certainly ahead of pop culture and fictional chars/places/things. The lists that ARE worth keeping probably need more visibility: such as, at least a Cat for 'Lists', and having the lists added as 'see also's to more articles, and put in more cats. I think putting more encyclopedic redlinks in front of people really helped jumpstart EN 5 years ago, and think it could help Simple, but we need to make them more visible. On the other hand, things like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_supermarkets.html" title="List of supermarkets">List of supermarkets</a> do NOT strike me as core topics, and I wouldn't mind seeing fluff like that deleted or minimalized. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_the_world%27s_tallest_structures.html" title="List of the world's tallest structures">List of the world's tallest structures</a> seems iffy to me, too. Maybe if limited to <i>buildings</i> (ie not antennae). Kept ones also need some review, as the copy of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_tectonic_plates.html" title="List of tectonic plates">List of tectonic plates</a> that was copied here had some BS that was later removed on EN, but given the lower traffic here stayed until I found it just recently.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess I should put my opinion out there: If there is a compelling reason to use an article title that doesn't match EN, I don't think we should be constricted by their choices. On the other hand, if the possible titles have more or less equal arguments, I do think it is worth matching EN, as it makes the interwiki links easier, and is more convenient for people that work on both projects. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 22:00, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How about a Schools portal? I know they're normally for specific topics, but I personally think that helping school pupils is more important than being simple for translators. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">Archer7</a> 19:04, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can you describe more about what you mean by 'schools portal'? If it's intent is to encourage articles about every specific/individual school building around the world (like has happened on EN), I think that's the last thing Simple needs (well, one of the last). If it has more to do with helping students access info RE the subjects they're studying, etc., then it sounds intriguing (even if potentially thorny to try and implement in a way that serves students around the globe). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 09:31, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It isn't for writing articles on schools, it would be a place teachers can direct their students to if they are using it in classes. The page would help pupils find out about Wikipedia and how to use it and give them easier access to whatever they are studying.

<dd>That sounds promising. I seem to remember dicussions on EN about how best to guide 'student projects'. It seems that ones where the instructor gave very clear guidelines, and made sure that attention to Wikipedia style and policy were part of the grading, were the most productive. One where students were told to 'just write an article' tended to produce large numbers of articles about student orgs on campus, dorms, etc., and most of them landed on AfD (then it was VfD). Providing instructors and students clear guidelines on contributing productively sounds like a very laudable project. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 08:37, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not a big fan of the 'make headers a question' style (I'd be more inclined to go with something like 'Special types of ministers') (and I have issues with "Prime Minister" being an 'easter egg' link to <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> despite the article implying it is talking about non-country-specific usage of the term), but as far as your specific question about the simplicity of the prose, it looks quite suitable to me. I guess what I'm saying is that I think you've got a good handle on how to put things in 'simple English', but you might want to focus on using more global references--ie, will it make as much sense to someone with an <i>n</i> thousand-word English vocabulary in <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somalia.html" title="Somalia">Somalia</a> as it does to a person with the same vocabulary in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>.

<dd>Special 'nice-to-have' features like that depend on people willing to update it every day. Apparently no one here has decided it is a high enough priority to commit to that level of maintenance. I think the most active editors here see Simple's mission as being not focused as much on the pop culture and 'hot topic of the day' mentality that the other Wikipedias lean towards. Instead, committing our limited editing resources to the core topics of the sciences, great thinkers, world history, world geography, the arts, the most lasting or impactful of literature and entertainment, etc. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.17.48.241.html" title="User:24.17.48.241">24.17.48.241</a> 19:10, 12 February 2006 (UTC) (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">User:Freshstart</a>--had to switch to a browser I'm not logged into because my other one is acting up.)</dd>

<dd>Since you haven't gotten an answer yet, i assume it's done a schedule to conserve resources. In lieu of waiting i would make a copy of the special page in a file on your hard drive. (If you want go to the trouble, you could edit-in wiki bullet-markup to format it, so you can save this editable version on a subpage like User:Archer7/Dead-end to do, so it is accessible to other editors.) They're probably in alpha order, or you could sort them. Call up your My contributions. Ignore the ones that don't say <b>(Top)</b> at the end of the line, since the ones that have been edited since since then are probably the ones <i>you</i> edited twice, with the most recent time being higher up on the page. Presumably your comments say what you did, and you know to look up each one that you finished in alpha order on your list, and remove it (or mark it if that makes more sense for the way you work).<br />

<dd>It's certainly a fair question (and I wouldn't worry too much about the quantity--Netoholic could probably do it in minutes with Netbot). I think the short answer is 'no'--neither it, nor variants/related (EG exterior) seem to be on the BE 850, BE 1500, or VOA lists. On the otherhand, since we're talking about uses in that header, and not content, and in that context it is arguably somewhat self-evident (especially with the little 'external link' icon next to each link), I'm not sure how critical it is to avoid using it there. If we do want to change it, I'd prefer 'other websites'--I think 'other' is a more concrete distinction, while 'outside' is a bit metaphorical. And, while website isn't exactly simple, site isn't either, and I would imagine website is more likely to be added to the VOA word list soon, as 'site' is so much more ambiguous. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 03:23, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to throw this out... keep in mind that we need not even keep the idea of an "External links" special section. I think information sources used should be in a "References" section, and mention in the article any official websites for the subject. That leaves things like fan sites or general information, which are debateably non-needed. I think the idea of the "External links" section was born in the fact that Wikipedia is <i>part</i> of the Internet, and linking is a key concept. But think of it this way... would you want to see "External links" in a print version of Wikipedia? -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 06:11, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Freshstart, bear in mind that if people don't know what 'website' means, they probably won't be here unless there's a printed version flying around like Netoholic said. Netoholic, I see what you're saying, but I think outside links are extremely helpful when researching a topic, I'm sure you've found them helpful at some point in your usage of Wikipedia. They give people access to information that perhaps would be a little out of place in an encyclopedia article. It's a little hard to explain, I hope you can see what I mean. 'Other websites' sounds a great replacement. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">Archer7</a> 11:16, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm OK with "External links", but "Other websites" is my first choice if we change to something else--I was just acknowledging that it doesn't actually pass the typical 'simple' tests, before someone else said it. FWIW 'reference' is BE1500<a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Reference" class="external autonumber" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Reference" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, so we don't need to avoid that.</dd>
<dd>As for whether we can get rid of the section entirely, I don't really think so, although Neto raises a good point. I DON'T think we should be adding them wholesale from EN--the quality and necessity of the ext links there is often pretty iffy. The two biggest reasons I can think of to have <i>selected</i> ext links here are: on stubs to facilitate expansion by future editors, and for 'official' links, especially to things like governmental entities. Maybe I'm just not getting exactly how the official links would be worked into the body content, but the typical [1] format I don't think is sufficient. I suppose for the stub growth purpose, they could be left on the Talk pages.<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 07:46, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd say we should <b>boldly</b> change it to "other websites" (preferably with a bot), and if someone has a good reason for wanting it a different way, they can <b>boldly</b> change it back or to something else. Wikis are great. Go for it!</dd>

<p>There's a rather large picture of a penis on the front page. If we could remove that, it'd be perfect. Thank you. Capitán Obvio 22:45, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reverted (by someone else). Thanks for helping us keep the main page penis-free. I wish these vandals would realize that their attacks are neither amusing, nor frustrating (just ho-hum reactions are the norm), nor original. Someone else did the same thing (and it was a penis picture then, too) a long time ago. Admittedly, there was more reaction then (such as "Ew!", see the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia%7ESimple_talk_Archive_1_9512.html" title="Wikipedia:Simple talk/Archive 1">archive</a> for the reactions), but it really does get old after a while. That was one of the reasons that Netoholic protected the Main page (wisely, I think), but this vandal was a bit more persistent than most, actually modifying the template that determines a section of the main page. Either way, the pic is gone now, and I'm guessing that vandal will be blocked any moment. Most of us have zero tolerance for that sort of thing. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 23:30, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You'd think that when this wiki is made for children, this part of Wikipedia would be decorated with children's colors, designs, and you know the rest. Like, why isn't the globe-logo colored with rainbow colors, and why aren't the fonts Comic Sans, or any other child-like fonts?</p>
<p>SE Wikipedia looks like it's still for adults. Can the design be changed? (After all, the Arabic Wikipedia at <a href="http://ar.wikipedia.org" class="external free" title="http://ar.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">http://ar.wikipedia.org</a> has a different, latticework background than the other Wikipedias do.) --<a href="../../../../en/s/h/u/User%7EShultz_III_f95d.html" class="extiw" title="en:User:Shultz_III">Shultz III</a> 08:49, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see any difference on the main page of the Arabic Wikipedia compared to other language Wikipedias, except that all the text is in Arabic script, which I suppose could be described as appearing lattice-like. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 20:10, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Freshstart is right. Even though children are welcome to visit Simple English Wikipedia, and are currently considered part of the target audience, they are not our only audience, and therefore changing the design to be more child-focused would be inappropriate. But as regards Arabic Wikipedia, I see what Shultz III is saying. He is saying that the background picture on that Wikipedia is not the same as the one here, with a sort of arabesque-style pattern visible. I'll post this on his talk page at English Wikipedia, too. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 21:45, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look at <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">The French Wikipedia</a>. Surely not all of them are children, or have difficulties grasping the language. Adding a few icons to touch up the interface has nothing to do with being simple of mind, growing up, or learning a langauage. Such designs (Didn"t <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">User:Archer7</a> propose some?) are worth considering. -- <a href="../../../e/p/t/User%7EEptalon_a472.html" title="User:Eptalon">Eptalon</a> 18:49, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's still not working in Mozilla, but I just tried opening the page in Konqueror, and the image displayed just fine. Perhaps the adblock plugin is mistaking the Captcha for an ad and refusing to display it.

<li>I found the problem—I had cookies disabled. Enabling cookies allows the image to be displayed. Can someone else please try this to see if the problem is reproducible?
