<p>I've been doing some work on categorizing older years (like BC old) and I had a thought. Many of the individual years don't have pages. I was wondering what the community thinks about redirecting individual year pages to the decade in which they occur (for example, redirect the year 44 BC to the decade <a href="../../../4/0/s/40s_BC_bf00.html" title="40s BC">40s BC</a>). If someone eventually wants to do the page for that specific year, they could. In the meantime, it might encourage people to help add info to the decades pages. Someone who's discouraged from creating the 44 BC page to say "Julius Caesar died in this year", may decide to add that comment to the 40s BC page simply because '44 BC' is a blue link instead of a red one. <a href="../../../t/y/g/User%7ETygartl1_4fd2.html" title="User:Tygartl1">Tygartl1</a> 22:18, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This reminded me of another issue concerning years. I know that when talking about history and archaeology, terms like "BCE" (Before Common Era) and "CE" (Common Era) are sometimes used instead of BC and AD. Is there some sort of guideline about this? Thanks. Oh, and I don't know yet about the parent question. I have to think about it. --<a href="../../../k/y/o/User%7EKyoko_ff36.html" title="User:Kyoko"><font face="arial" color="#8652B9"><i>Kyok</i></font></a><a href="../../../k/y/o/User_talk%7EKyoko_c847.html" title="User talk:Kyoko"><font face="arial" color="#BA55D3"><i>o</i></font></a> 03:39, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A 1993 <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/68/20/120.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/68/20/120.html" rel="nofollow">Guideline</a> says <i>don’t use B.C.E., C.E., or A.C.E. to replace B.C. and A.D. without translating the new terms for the very large number of readers who will not understand them</i>. As this is simple English wikipedia, and AD and BC are, so much I dare say, much more widely understood, AD and BC should be used. For AD, the discussion is moot anyway, as the year 500 AD is linked under <a href="../../../5/0/0/500.html" title="500">500</a>, similar to all common era years. On enWP, BCE redirects to BC, I don't think this is really necessary here (yet). It would certainly, however, be a neutral way of resolving the issue.</dd>
<dd>So much for the simplicity argument, here is why I don't really like BCE and CE: They are meant as a political correct way of stating years. They try to achieve this by avoiding the term "Christ". They still, however, are built upon the year Christ was born. Therefore, I don't see substantial improvement over AD and BC. Also, Common Era refers to the Christian common era. What about the common era of the Jews? of the Buddhist? of the Hindu? If anything, I find defining the Common Era to be the Christian common era to be less politically correct than stating directly that the Christian base of calculation is used. --<a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimshot_f600.html" title="User:Rimshot">Rimshot</a> 10:50, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>AD belongs before the number,not after, since it is an abbreviation of the latin Anno Domini, meaning "In the Year of Our Lord", which makes no grammatical sense after the date. Whilst I recognise that this is the Simple English Wikipedia, nonetheless the correct use of grammar is as important, if not more so since many users are likely to be those learning English. For the benefit of htese people, it seems wise to ensure that the rules of the language are properly applied, both to help understand what is a somewhat awkward language, and reducing the chance of users becomming confused over the correct syntax of sentences . Furthermore, mistakes of this sort merely make the poster look as if he is either ignorant, foolish, or merely lazy. I understand that people who do not speak fluent English may desire to post on this site, and meaning no disrespect to them, I would suggest taht they post thier contributions to the English rather thann Simplified English Wikipedia, on the basis that the readers of the English Wikipedia are more likely to be those who are more capable of muddling out he nonsense which gets posted there by idiots, so understanding a bit of bad translation, and improving it to a suitable standard for inclusion in the article, is far easier. <small>— This unsigned comment was added by 150.101.102.188 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_150.101.102.188_bd7c.html" title="Special:Contributions/150.101.102.188">contribs</a>) 15:30, 25 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Redirecting red-linked years sounds like a good idea. I wonder, though, whether that would discourage creating the corresponding year article, once there is enough content. Year article stubs, I think, would help more. They could provide a link to the decade, as well. Creating such a stub would be simple if there was a suitable template (is there one?). If a year isn't linked to, there is no need to create the corresponding article. --<a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimshot_f600.html" title="User:Rimshot">Rimshot</a> 10:50, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, perhaps we could do individual years up to a certain point going back in history. What I had sort of envisioned was, as you continue travelling backwards along the timeline, going from having pages for individual years, to summarizing by decade, to perhaps eventually summarizing by century. Obviously, the further back in time you go, the more gaps there are going to be in between events (also, the gaps will get larger as well). It just doesn't make sense to me to have a page for a year where history only recognizes a handful of events. It makes more sense to me to have a summary on a decade page. The only thing I don't know exactly is to where to make the cutoff. Starting in 1st century BC seems like a logical place to begin the decade summary.</p>
<p>As far as a template, we have something (as seen on <a href="../../../4/0/s/40s_BC_bf00.html" title="40s BC">40s BC</a>) but I'm not sure if there's a simpler template that exists. What's there is kind of confusing and seems like it might take a lot of work to change for each page. <a href="../../../t/y/g/User%7ETygartl1_4fd2.html" title="User:Tygartl1">Tygartl1</a> 15:03, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as redirecting non-existent article years to the decade, that has already been done on and off for quite some time, and it doesn't bother me. It gives some information on the timeframe, while we are waiting for a year article to be made. <i><a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User_talk%7EBlockinblox_5d15.html" title="User talk:Blockinblox">talk</a></i> 15:12, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I forgot to mention another argument I had for doing a decade summary. The further back in time you go, the more likely it is that historians are unsure of the exact year of a person's birth or death.

<p>I'm sorry for the somewhat silly question. I want to know how to write my future changes. Is this the <i>(Simple English) Wikipedia</i> or the <i>Simple (English Wikipedia)</i>.

<dd>While it is not so much a need here, using Town, State is usually the best idea with or without shared names. It helps when linking other pages when consistancy is used naming pages in this way. Unfortunately, it can get screwy at times. Many English cities (and likely some Australian ones as well as other countries) tend to either be listed just as city name or as City, Country. Redirects for more unique cities without the ", State" are a good idea to use as well, but the city realy should be listed in the manner you listed just to keep things consistant. -- <font color="#770044"><b><a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreol_5a8b.html" title="User:Creol">Creol</a></b><small>(<a href="../../../c/r/e/User_talk%7ECreol_0bce.html" title="User talk:Creol">talk</a>)</small></font> 13:08, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, just have a little question I wanted to throw out there to see if anyone can provide some guidance. In articles regarding specific animals (see <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lampyridae.html" title="Lampyridae">firefly</a> as an example), I would assume that Simple Wikipedia should still have taxoboxes similar to English Wikipedia, but I was wondering if Simple Wiki has any guidelines on taxoboxes, as the form that they take in English Wiki is far from "simple". I would imagine that the beginning English speaker would just look at taxoboxes as they are and dismiss them as a bunch of complex mumbojumbo. <a href="../../../j/h/m/User%7EJhml_f836.html" title="User:Jhml">Jhml</a> 18:06, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Taxonomy is actually fairly universal (for languages that use the same or similar alphabets atleast). Look at the firefly taxobox here, then look at the French, Italian and Spanish ones. While the names of the categories differ in each language, the classification of the animal or plants covered stay pretty much the same. Certain languages (Dutch for example) have their own names, but still list the commonly accepted names and just note what the Dutch version is. Taxonomy itself is certainly not a simple subject, but the language used to deal with taxonomy in English is in many cases the same as it is in many other languages so for non-English speakers it is little different than learning it in their own language. So basically? copy/pasting taxoboxes is pretty much a fairly well accepted practice. Most people will trim the subspecies varieties at the bottom of the box, but this is more a case of that information being just too much detail (and a whole lot of red-links that will never get created) for Simple wiki at this point. -- <font color="#770044"><b><a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreol_5a8b.html" title="User:Creol">Creol</a></b><small>(<a href="../../../c/r/e/User_talk%7ECreol_0bce.html" title="User talk:Creol">talk</a>)</small></font> 18:26, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really do feel kind of silly for asking this, but I'm kind of obsessive compulsive, and there's an error on the editing page for creating a new page. It says "If a page use to be here", when it should say "If a page used to be here". If someone higher up could fix it, that would be great!

<dd>Interestingly enough, this is not as cut-and-dried as you probably think it is. I thought it was too, but it turns out that there is disagreement among grammarians regarding which is correct. "Used to" is considered more correct by some (such as <i>A Dictionary of Modern Usage</i> (1998) by Bryan A. Garner), but others disagree. I don't know where I read that, but it surprised me, too, which is why I remember it now. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 17:13, 27 March 2007 (UTC) (login problems)</dd>

<p>We really should be focusing on the quality of our articles. They really are not to great no offense.

<dd>There are over 200 articles that need to be cleaned up, not counting those in the second person (<i>you</i>), or those classified as dictionary definitions.
