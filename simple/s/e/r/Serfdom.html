	    <p><b>Serfdom</b> is a legal and economic system.</p>
<p>A serf is a laborer who has to stay in one area. Serfs were the lowest social class of the feudal society. Serfs were different than <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slaves</a>. Serfs could have <a href="../../../p/r/o/Property.html" title="Property">property</a>. In most serfdoms, serfs were legally part of the land, and if the land was sold, they were sold with it.</p>
<p>Serfdom is the forced labour of serfs, on the fields of the land owners. Serfs got protection and the right to work on the leased fields. Serfs worked in fields, and other agricultural-related works, like <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forestry.html" title="Forestry">forestry</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transportation.html" title="Transportation">transportation</a> (both land and river-based), work in <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craft.html" title="Craft">craft</a> and even in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manufacture.html" title="Manufacture">manufactures</a>.</p>
<p>Serfdom came from <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> slavery of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> and spread through <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> around the 10th century. Most people lived in serfdoms during the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> of Europe.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> serfdom lasted up to the 1600s, in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> until 1789. In most other European countries serfdom lasted until the early 19th century.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../s/e/r/Serfdom.html" title="Edit section: Etymology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word "Serf" came from the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>servus</i>, with means "slave."</p>
<p><a name="The_system_of_serfdom" id="The_system_of_serfdom"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../s/e/r/Serfdom.html" title="Edit section: The system of serfdom">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The system of serfdom</span></h2>
<p>All land was owned by landowners - <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobility.html" title="Nobility">nobility</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">Church</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch.html" title="Monarch">monarchs</a>. A serf is any peasant who has to do manual labor for someone else in order to get to keep his land.</p>
<p>While most serfs were <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farmer.html" title="Farmer">farmers</a>, some serfs were craftsman - like the village <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacksmith.html" title="Blacksmith">blacksmith</a>, miller or <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inn.html" title="Inn">innkeeper</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../s/e/r/Serfdom.html" title="Edit section: The serf's feudal contract">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The serf's feudal contract</span></h3>
<p>The serfs had a feudal contract, just like a baron or a <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">knight</a>. A serf's feudal contract was that he would live on and work a piece of land held by his Lord. The serf would get protection in return.</p>
<p>During that time, people said that the a serf "worked for all", a knight or baron "fought for all" and a churchman "prayed for all." Everyone had his place and all was right with God's world. The serf did not have as good a position as the knights or barons, but was better than <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a>. Serfs had some rights in the feudal contract.</p>
<p>A manorial Lord could not sell his serfs like Romans can sell their slaves. If his Lord sold some land, the serf of that land went with it to serve their new Lord. A serf could not leave his lands without permission. A serf could not sell his lands.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../s/e/r/Serfdom.html" title="Edit section: Becoming a serf">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Becoming a serf</span></h3>
<p>A <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free.html" title="Free">free</a> man became a serf usually because of a large debt. He would make an agreement with the lord of the land. The lord would keep him safe, give money for his debt, and give him land to work on, and he would do work for the lord. All his children would become serfs.</p>
<p><a name="The_serf.27s_duties" id="The_serf.27s_duties"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../s/e/r/Serfdom.html" title="Edit section: The serf's duties">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The serf's duties</span></h3>
<p>The usual serf "paid" his fees and taxes by working for the lord 2 or 3 days a week. At different times in the year he would do different things. He could plough his lord's fields. He could harvest crops, dig ditches, or repair fences. The rest of his time he could take care of his own fields, crops and animals.</p>
<p>The big problem for serfs was that he had to do the work for the lord before he could do his own work. When his lord’s crops needed to be harvested, his needed to be harvested, too. The lord would give them very good food when they worked for him.</p>
<p>The serf also had to pay taxes and fees. The lord decided how much taxes they would pay from how much land the serf had, usually 1/3 of their value. They had to give money for fees when they got married, had a baby, or there was a war.. Money was very not common then, so usually they paid by giving food instead of money.</p>
<p>There were strange tests to decide if something was good enough to be given for taxes. A chicken, for example, had to be able to jump over a fence. That showed that the chicken was young and healthy.</p>

<p>A serf had some freedom. A serf could get and keep property and money. Some serfs had more money and property than their free neighbours. A serf could sometimes buy his freedom.</p>
<p>Serfs could grow what they wanted on their lands. Sometimes their taxes had to be paid in wheat, which is very difficult to grow. They took the wheat they didn’t give for taxes to the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Market.html" title="Market">market</a>. Their heirs usually got an <a href="../../../i/n/h/Inheritance.html" title="Inheritance">inheritance</a>.</p>
<p>The lord could not make the serfs leave his land unless he had good reasons. The lord was supposed to protect them from criminals or other lords, and he was supposed to give them charity during famines.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../s/e/r/Serfdom.html" title="Edit section: Variations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Variations</span></h3>
<p>The rules for serfdom were different at different times and places. In some places, serfdom changed into different types of taxation.</p>
<p>In different places and times, serfs had to work different amounts. In the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth_68ac.html" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> in the 13th century it was 2 - 3 days a year. In the 14th century, serfs had to work one day per week. They had to work 4 days per week in the 17th century. They had to work 6 days per week in the 18th century.</p>
<p>Sometimes, serfs were soldiers during war. They could get freedom or even ennoblement for bravery in war. In other cases, serfs could also purchase their freedom, be manumitted by their enlightened or generous owners, or flee to towns or newly-settled land where few questions were asked. Laws varied from country to country: in England a serf who made his way to a chartered town and evaded recapture for a year and a day obtained his freedom.</p>
<p>In many cases, serfs had to get permission from their lord to marry someone who was not a serf for that lord.</p>
<p>Sometimes serf had to pay money because of something they did. This is called a fine. They had to pay a fine when they inherited money or property. They had to pay a fine if they became a priest or monk. They had to pay a fine if their children went to the city instead of staying and being a serf. They had to give their best animal to their lord when they died so that their children would get to stay on the land.</p>
<p>A serfs had to pay to use the lord’s grain mill and bread oven. They had to pay to use the lord’s carts to carry their produce. The serfs were very angry about that. Many peasants had to pay a fine because they used their own grain mill. The miller charged a fee called (multure), which was usually 1/24 of the total grain milled. The serfs often thought the millers were not honest. Many lords made the serfs use the lord's oven to bake their daily bread.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../s/e/r/Serfdom.html" title="Edit section: Freedom for the serfs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Freedom for the serfs</span></h3>
<p>Serfdom began to change because lords could make more money just renting the land. Many Lords "freed" their serfs to get cash from their serfs instead of work from them.</p>
<p>This didn’t really change the serfs’ life. They still had to farm their lands to feed their families, and pay their taxes. The main difference was that they could be forced off their lands if they didn’t pay the rent, or if their Lord decided he wanted to use their fields for raising sheep (for example) rather than corn.</p>
<p>The lords took the best land for themselves. Even though the serfs were “free”, their life was harder.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../s/e/r/Serfdom.html" title="Edit section: History of serfdom">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History of serfdom</span></h2>
<p>There were social systems like serfdom in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_history.html" title="Ancient history">ancient times</a>.</p>
<p>The helots in the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greek</a> city-state of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Sparta</a> and the peasants working on government lands in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">ancient Rome</a> worked like serfs, but they did not use that name.</p>
<p>They were called coloni, or "tenant farmers”. The Germanic tribes took over the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>. They took the lands from the wealthy Romans as the landlords but left the economic system of serfdom.</p>
<pre>
The serfdom of medieval times began with the breakup of the Carolingian Empire around the 10th century. This empire had ruled most of western Europe for more than 200 years. It was followed by a long time when there were no strong central governments in most of Europe.
</pre>
<p>During this time, <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudalism.html" title="Feudalism">feudal lords</a> worked to make serfdom the common way for people to live. Serfdom was the system where great landlords could make sure other people worked to feed them and are forced, legally and economically, to keep doing that.</p>
<p>This system gave most of the agricultural labor during the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. There was <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a> during the Middle Ages, but it was not common. Usually they were only slaves to take care of people’s houses. Parts of Europe, including much of <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, never used serfdom or other feudal institutions.</p>
<p>In the later Middle Ages serfdom began to go away west of the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhine.html" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> even as it grew in Eastern Europe. This was one important cause for the deep differences between the societies and economies of eastern and western Europe.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Europe_1e16.html" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a>, the rise of powerful <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch.html" title="Monarch">monarchs</a>, towns, and an improving economy weakened the manorial system through the 13th and 14th centuries. Serfdom was not common after the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>.</p>
<p>Serfdom in Western Europe mostly ended in the 15th and 16th centuries. This was because of changes in the economy, population, and laws about what lords could make their tenants do in Western European nations.</p>
<p>Because money was easier to get, it was now cheaper to pay workers than to keep a serf on the land the traditional way. If a worker was not needed, he was not hired.</p>
<p>At the same time, there were more protests by serfs and peasants, like Tyler’s Rebellion in England in 1381. This put pressure on the nobility and the clergy to change the system and make it better. The new ways of renting the land gave people more freedom.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> helped end serfdoms. Farmers wanted to move to towns to make more money than working in the fields. Land owners also put their money into industries that made more money for them. This caused urbanization.</p>

<p>Serfdom reached <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Europe_ef2f.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern European</a> countries later than Western Europe. It became the main way around the 15th century. Before that time, Eastern Europe had less people than Western Europe. The lords of Eastern Europe tried to make people want to move there from Western Europe. Serfdom developed in Eastern Europe after the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Death_ffa3.html" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> epidemics. That stopped the people moving to Eastern Europe, and many people who were already there died.</p>
<p>There were not very many people for all the land. It was very important to the land owners in Eastern Europe really needed to keep the people on the land, so they needed the serfdom system. Later, serfdom stayed all over Eastern Europe during the 17th century so that <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobility.html" title="Nobility">nobility</a>-owned estates could grow more crops (especially grain) to export to Western Europe.</p>
<p>The Eastern European countries include <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prussia.html" title="Prussia">Prussia</a> (Prussian Ordinances of 1525), <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> (laws of late 15th/early 16th century), the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth_68ac.html" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> (szlachta privileges of early 16th century) and the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Empire_7810.html" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a> (laws of late 16th/first half of 17th century).</p>
<p>There was slower industry development and urbanisation of those regions because there was so much serfdom. That was called a 'second serfdom' or 'export-led serfdom'. That lasted until the mid-19th century.</p>
<p>In many of these countries serfdom ended during the Napoleonic invasions of the early <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteenth_century.html" title="Nineteenth century">nineteenth century</a>. There was still serfdom in Russia until <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_19.html" title="February 19">February 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>. In Russian Baltic provinces it ended in the beginning of 19th century (Russian Serfdom Reforms). Russian serfdom was different than in other Eastern European countries, because it wasn’t changed by German law and people coming from Germany. The serfdom and manorialism systems were forced by the crown (<a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsar.html" title="Tsar">Tsar</a>), not the nobility.</p>

<p>Some people say that planned economies, especially those based on <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a>-style <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communist</a> economics, such as the Soviet collective farm system, are government-owned serfdom. Friedrich Hayek said that in his book <i>Road to Serfdom</i> . Mikhael Gorbachev]] believed that, too. In some Communist countries, farmers were tied to their farms. Some were called kolkhoz which were supposed to be collectives. Some were called sovkhoz which were state-owned. The government used a system of internal passports and household registration (such as China's hukou system) to make people stay on their farms. They had to plant crops according to instructions from the central authorities, especially if they were on state-run farms. These authorities would then "buy" their agricultural produce at very low prices and use the money they made to invest in heavy industry.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>

This was the first time in Russian history that had happened. It is possible that a system like this still is happening in rural <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>.</p>
