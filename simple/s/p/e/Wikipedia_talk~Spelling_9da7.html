	    <p>I remain unconvinced about the suggestion that AE ought be changed to BE. It seems petty and is something which is likely to annoy most writers. It annoys me and I am British. Both are correct, so why change one to the other? I can't see any benefit to it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></p>
<p>Then don't do it. But surely you can see that if you prevent others from doing it, then we will have seesaw wars with U.S. spelling imposed by Americans, and British spelling by almost everyone else. I have never seen an International English say used by an NGO that did not specify British-style spellings... never. Academic papers for international conferences that are more than just US+Canada are always in International English which means British spelling, and when they're in Canada sometimes they just say "either way is fine". ONLY US-ONLY institutions require US spellings. But plenty require British spellings. This is something the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Users_8a5b.html" title="Simple English Users">Simple English Users</a> have to deal with. Americans just invade, while the NGOs actually give them food. So whose spelling is more important to them?</p>
<p>Another benefit is that words like "<a href="../../../c/e/n/Centre.html" title="Centre">centre</a>" are then the same in both English and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>. This tends to be useful in names, as anyone who has visited Canada knows.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This way lies madness.&#160;:-) This is supposed to be an English-language Wikipedia; we can't start worrying about how other languages do things. -- <a href="../../../r/j/w/User%7ERJWiki_76d0.html" title="User:RJWiki">RJWiki</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No one is "worrying". It's just a side benefit of using International/Australian/Canadian/British spellings that a very few words end up the same in French, like <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilometre.html" title="Kilometre">kilometre</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centre.html" title="Centre">centre</a>, etc.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A few random thoughts: 1) As I understand it, the En Wikipedia has an explicit policy of not favoring either <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British English</a> or <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This policy is provably stupid. Do a thought experiment: you have a Brit and an American both editing an article. Each changes all the spellings to "his own" every time he edits... the number of unnecessary edits mounts, and it really NEVER ends... eventually one standard or another wins out by sheer weight... better to choose.
<dl>
<dd>In theory, maybe. In practice neither changes the spellings unless they occur in a piece of text which is being completely rewritten. That's my experience anyway. The only exception is when a newbie doesn't know any better. -- Derek Ross</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>2) Personally, I have a pretty strong irrational prejudice against British English spellings (they usually seem affected to me).</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's good to fight these prejudices.</dd>
</dl>
<p>3) I think at this stage of the game (Oct 2003), we should be basing our SEWiki <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_f1f8.html" title="Simple English">Simple English</a> on <i>something</i>, and the most logical something to begin with is <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_English_33a0.html" title="Basic English">Basic English</a>, which does or doesn't use the British English spellings?? I had assumed that it did, but looking at our <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_English_Alphabetical_Wordlist_ac17.html" title="Basic English Alphabetical Wordlist">Basic English Alphabetical Wordlist</a> it apparently doesn't. -- <a href="../../../r/j/w/User%7ERJWiki_76d0.html" title="User:RJWiki">RJWiki</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I know, <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_English_33a0.html" title="Basic English">Basic English</a> is an American thing, so it would use the American spellings. I think going the same way as the English WP does is best; allow both versions and don't go round changing them arbitrarily. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's not up to either of you whether anyone else "changes them arbitrarily". It's only up to either of you whether you want to waste your time running around telling those who do, to stop it. I think the proposal to tell only those turning British into US spelling to stop it, is sound, because it has to be one way or the other.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I thought BE was British. Quick Google search seems to confirm this. See for example <a href="http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/begr.html" class="external free" title="http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/begr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/begr.html</a> -- <a href="../../../r/j/w/User%7ERJWiki_76d0.html" title="User:RJWiki">RJWiki</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>It's irrelevant. We've already agreed <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_English_33a0.html" title="Basic English">Basic English</a> just is not rich enough for what we're trying to do here.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Consistency is important, because otherwise you just confuse people. It is not "simple" to have two different spellings for the same word. It makes more sense to use British English spellings, as that is what most international things use.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's exactly what the original statement said. For some reason the idea of letting Americans not only write in their own idiom, but letting them change British to American spellings, appeals to <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a> and <a href="../../../r/j/w/User%7ERJWiki_76d0.html" title="User:RJWiki">RJWiki</a>. This is just foolish. I agree completely, British only, Death to America and all that.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The most important time to be consistent is in titles of pages. If you don't know what spelling the title to a page is in you aren't going to be able to link to it correctly. You could have loads of redirects, but it is easier to just have one policy so you can link directly. -- <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tango.html" title="Tango">Tango</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely. The insanity over at <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_English_ee46.html" title="Full English">Full English</a> leads to labor and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_%28economics%29.html" title="Labour (economics)">labour (economics)</a>, behavioural economics and behavioral finance. Its obviously wrong. We should just not permit that to happen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, it's now 2 for strict British-only spellings, 2 still whining about letting writers *change* British to American spelling - is this some new human right we haven't heard of? Confusing people?
<dl>
<dd>Oh yes, the right to confuse, the 42nd amendment.&#160;;-) -- <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tango.html" title="Tango">Tango</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Therein lies a mess. &#160;:)</p>
<p>The following interesting footnote appears in BASIC ENGLISH: International Second Language (<a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/isl111.html#ednote" class="external free" title="http://ogden.basic-english.org/isl111.html#ednote" rel="nofollow">http://ogden.basic-english.org/isl111.html#ednote</a>) as footnote 10...</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Although Ogden refused to associate Basic with any movement for spelling reform, he was, of course, prepared to accept whatever could be accomplished, and he recommended that "wherever possible without arousing prejudice, the changes already achieved in America should be extended to the rest of the English-speaking world." Accordingly, in The Basic Words as here printed in Section Two, the American spellings, behavior, color, harbor, humor, and plow will be found</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It was written by the editor for the 1968 edition and seems to pretty conclusively prove that we should be using American spelling if we are to follow Ogden's own intentions. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> 06:56, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's a footnote to the following paragraphs...</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A chief obstacle to the spread of English has hitherto been its phonetic irregularity, the frequency with which the same symbols are used to represent different sounds, and the uncertainties of stress. There is the fact that the word fish, as Sir Richard Paget has noted, might appear as ghoti (gh as in enough, etc.); and if dealt with in the same way foolish might be spelled in 613,975 different ways.</i></dd>
<dd><i>To master such details in a vocabulary of 20,000 words, or even 2,000, necessitates an amount of drudgery which has given phoneticians and advocates of synthetic languages their opportunity. With the Basic vocabulary, however, such irregularities are reduced to a minimum in which, by treating each word as an individual, the learner can even profit by its peculiar appearance in written form as an aid to memory, and historical continuity can thus be preserved. The 850 sounds being fixed by the gramophone records, their written forms can be memorized as individual entities, with no special emphasis on any principle but that of stress.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Phonetic (spelling) reform can thus be left to pursue its separate path. It may find Basic a useful ally, and Basic may later profit by its progress. Hence the importance of Basic for educational work which cannot allow itself to be involved in controversies such as any violent departure from the habits of centuries must always engender.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>...which again appear to support the case that Ogden liked the idea of spelling reform in principle, American or otherwise. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> 07:12, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
