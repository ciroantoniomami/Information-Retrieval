<div style="margin: 1em; padding: 0.2em; border-top: 2px solid #ddd; border-bottom:2px solid #ddd;" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>The text below is about parts of the story or how it ends.</i></b></div>
<p>It has been two years since the end of the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_%28film%29_2550.html" title="Spider-Man (film)">last film</a>, and Peter Parker is finding his double life increasingly difficult. Precariously struggling to balance his crime-fighting duties with the demands of his normal life, Peter often finds his personal life taking a backseat. He loses a job, faces financial difficulties, and struggles to maintain his <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a> studies. Moreover, he has become estranged from both love-interest Mary Jane and best friend Harry Osborn, and Aunt May is threatened with foreclosure. He questions if he could ever have what he "needs," a life as Peter Parker, which climaxes in a vision involving Uncle Ben.</p>
<p>Harry, now head of Oscorp's research division, has invested in the research of brilliant <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientist.html" title="Scientist">scientist</a> Otto Octavius. To perform a sustained <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fusion.html" title="Fusion">fusion</a> experiment, he has developed a set of artificially intelligent mechanical arms. When the experiment overloads and becomes unstable, Octavius' wife is killed, his neural chip, which enabled him to control the arms, is destroyed, and Octavius' mechanical arms become fused to his spine. The tentacles begin to control Octavius and he decides he must complete his experiment at any cost. J. Jonah Jameson names him Doctor Octopus. Octavius attempts to rob a bank where Peter Parker and his Aunt May happen to be present. After a short glitch in his powers, Spider-Man manages to foil the robbery, but Octavius takes Aunt May as a hostage. When Spider-Man rescues her, she revises her former opinion of him and realizes that he is a hero. During a party, Peter learns that M.J. is planning to marry John Jameson; shortly afterwards he loses his powers while web-slinging across town. Peter resolves to give up being Spider-Man. Back home, after visiting Uncle Ben's grave, Aunt May is distressed by Peter's confession that he was somewhat responsible for his Uncle Ben's death. Aunt May and Peter reconcile, and she tells Peter of the hope that Spider-Man brings to others, in spite of what dreams he may have to sacrifice. Peter attempts to re-connect with Mary Jane, but she informs him it is too late. In the meantime, Doctor Octopus agrees to capture Spider-Man for Harry, if Harry supplies him with more tritium for his experiment.</p>
<p>Mary Jane meets Peter in a coffee shop to ask if Peter still loves her, but Peter tells her that he does not. Amidst this exchange, the two are ambushed by Doctor Octopus, who abducts Mary Jane in a ploy to lure Spider-Man into a trap. This brings back Peter's powers. He dons his costume and engages in a fight with Octavius, culminating with the insane scientist forcing Spider-Man to rescue a runaway subway train. Still weak, he is captured by Doctor Octopus, and then delivered to Harry Osborn. Harry unmasks Spider-Man and is stunned to discover that his sworn enemy is also his best friend. Peter awakens and convinces Harry to reveal Octavius' whereabouts so he can rescue Mary Jane. Spider-Man finds Doctor Octopus in an abandoned warehouse on a waterfront pier, where he's restarted his <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fusion.html" title="Fusion">fusion</a> experiment. Peter reveals his true identity to Octavius, and pleads with him to stop the machine. Determined to end his doomsday experiment before it causes more harm, Octavius uses his mechanical arms to collapse the floor of the building, plunging the fusion device into the water below and him along with it. Mary Jane sees Peter without his mask and realizes that he is Spider-Man. But Peter tells her they can never be together, as he will always have enemies.</p>
<p>Across town, Harry has visions of his father, the late Norman Osborn in a hanging mirror. The <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallucination.html" title="Hallucination">hallucination</a> of Norman demands that his son kill Peter Parker to avenge his death. Harry hurls a dagger at the mirror, shattering it and revealing a hidden passageway which leads to a secret room in the attic. Upon entering, Harry sees a Goblin Glider in the center of the room and realizes that his father was the Green Goblin. At the end of the film, Mary Jane finds Peter in his apartment, telling him that she has decided to be with him - despite the risks. She persuades Peter to finally let her in while accepting the need of his vows by letting him respond to a sudden call for help.</p>

The record is now held by Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, although Spider-Man 2 still holds the Wednesday Opening Day record by quite a margin, opening with nearly $6 million more than The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King the year before.</p>
<p>The film grossed $88.1 million in its opening weekend, which is a large sum but far from a record; indeed, the film's opening weekend gross currently stands at #11 on the All-Time charts. In its first six days the film had grossed over $180 million and eventually went on to gross $373.5 million, becoming the second-highest grossing film of 2004, behind Shrek 2's $441.2 million take. Worldwide, the film grossed $783.8 million, ranking behind Shrek 2 and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_0096.html" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Elements of the film's plot are taken from the Stan Lee written Spider-Man storylines "If this be My Destiny" (<i>Amazing Spider-Man</i> (vol. 1) #31-33), <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i> (vol. 1) #50, and the first Spider-Man annual).</li>
<li>One of the suggested names for Doctor Octopus is Doctor Strange (to which Jameson replies "but it's taken"), which is Steve Ditko's other major co-creation for Marvel Comics.</li>
<li>A woman with the violin sings a song about Spider-Man. That song was actually the theme song of the 1967 <i>Spider-Man</i> series, although the tone and tempo was changed in the movie. This was also the same song sung by a man in the subway in the first film.</li>
<li>Dr. Curtis Connors actually appears in the film as Peter's physics professor. In the comics, Connors becomes The Lizard due to a serum he makes from Lizard DNA to regrow his arm.</li>
<li>The shot of Spider-man's suit left in the bin with Peter walking away is a homage to a splash panel from <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i> #50, with the line "I am Spider-Man no more!" being a direct reference to that issue.</li>
<li>A book of Spider-Man related jokes was published as a tie-in to this film. The book includes jokes such as: "If Spider-Man and M.J. wanted to get married, what would they plan? A huge webbing!"<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></li>

<ul>
<li>Tobey Maguire's back problems, which set the film's production back several months, were also referenced in the film itself. When Peter Parker tries to leap off of a building, he falls to the ground in an alleyway. When he stands he winces crying "My back! My back!". As clarified by both Raimi and Maguire, the line was not intially poking fun at Maguire's problems - it was simply a line gag (ex. "I'm back! I'm back! My back! My back!"). But once Raimi heard about Maguire's back problems he was considering taking the line out of the movie, but Maguire wanted to do it so Raimi left it in.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></li>
<li>The name of Peter's landlord, "Ditkovitch", was an obvious hat-tip to <i>Spider-Man</i> co-creator Steve Ditko.</li>
<li><i>Spider-Man</i> creator Stan Lee makes yet another cameo appearance (as he did in <i>Spider-Man</i>, and every other Marvel film) during Spidey's first battle with Doc Ock.</li>
<li>Phil LaMarr appears as an extra in the movie. He can be seen in the train. The appearance is not credited.</li>
<li>Tobey Maguire's younger half-brothers also appear in the train sequence as the young boys who hand Peter Parker his discarded Spider-Man mask. Neither is credited.</li>
<li><i>Spider-Man 2</i> is the first movie to be released in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Media_Disc_ca4f.html" title="Universal Media Disc">UMD</a> format for the <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_Portable_9564.html" title="PlayStation Portable">PSP</a>. The first one million copies of the U.S. PSP included the movie free.</li>
<li>The scene in which J. K. Simmons (as J. Jonah Jameson) shouts "Spider-Man was... A THIEF!" caused much hilarity around the set. Simmons was wearing false teeth for Jameson's trademark scrooge smile, and whenever he tried to form the "TH" he spat out his false teeth. These scenes can be seen on the blooper reel of the DVD.</li>
<li>There is a cameo of <i>Queer as Folk</i> star Hal Sparks. The character of Michael Novotny is a comic fan in the television series. Hal Sparks earlier work was the host of E!'s Talk Soup. The current host of a revamped version of Talk Soup called The Soup is Joel McHale, who makes a cameo as the account manager Peter and Aunt May speak with at the bank.</li>
<li>It was the first film with over 4,000 theaters for an opening day and second for overall counts.</li>
<li>Willem Dafoe enjoyed working on the first film so much that he offered to return for the sequel, so long as Raimi could write him in somewhere. Raimi obliged with his request, and Norman Osborn's cameo scene was the end result.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></li>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_director.html" title="Film director">Film director</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Landis_661f.html" title="John Landis">John Landis</a> has a cameo appearance in the scene in which Doctor Octopus is in the <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospital</a> after the accident.</li>
<li>Sam Raimi was the second student to hit Peter with his back pack.</li>
<li>Donnell Rawlings has a minor role in the beginning when Peter Parker delivers the pizzas.</li>
<li>Dan Hicks makes a cameo appearance as one of the passengers on the runaway train. Dan Hicks played the character Jake in another Sam Raimi film, Evil Dead 2.</li>
<li>In the commentary Sam Raimi says that the hospital scene was the first scene they started filming and the first one to be done.</li>
<li>In an easter egg on the second disk of the DVD version of the movie, Willem Dafoe makes a surprise cameo as he practices the first fusion experiment scene in Alfred Molina's place, much to Molina's surprise and delight.</li>
