	    <p>IMO, this article doesn't use as "simple" english as it could .</p>
<p>What is the policy on stubs (short articles)? I guess as this is meant to be a <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary.html" title="Dictionary">dictionary</a> as well, we should just write something every time we see a "?" link, and just leave it as a simple <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition.html" title="Definition">definition</a> until someone with more knowledge can come along and write an article. -- <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tango.html" title="Tango">Tango</a></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>general waffle on policies</i> - Hmmm - well, I wouldn't say there is a policy. Policies need to be formed by consensus and until there's more discussion on such things we won't know if there is a consensus or not. In general I would say go with the rules of any other Wikipedia you are familiar with unless there is a good reason not to. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>my opinion on stubs</i> - Personally, I am far more tolerant of stubs here than I am at the English Wikipedia. We are not really meant to be a dictionary, but I do think there is some value in having a page to describe a common term, especially if that term is complicated. The advantage is that you can then use that term in an article without having to simplify it. Simple words are best, but sometimes you need to use a complex or <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jargon.html" title="Jargon">jargon</a> word. The solution is to decribe it elsewhere so those who can not understand it can at least easily find out. An alternative is to have a page which contains the contents of lots of stubs, like instead of a page on <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addition.html" title="Addition">addition</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiplication.html" title="Multiplication">multiplication</a>, you ould have one page on mathematical terms and redirect those two to that. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The general policy on most wikipedia's is that stubs are bad, as far as i know, but i think this wiki might benifit from allowing stubs. I didn't expect there to be a policy already, i was really just trying to start a discussion. I'm not so keen on putting pages together; a list of terms all linking to the relevent page would be good, but i think it is better to have the pages separate so they don't have to be separated later if someone wants to make them longer, which should be the aim of all stubs. -- <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tango.html" title="Tango">Tango</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>If something has potential to be more than a stub, then you might be right - best to leave it. But I'm not sure if things like <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addition.html" title="Addition">addition</a> could be more than that. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>You and i can't see anything more to say, but some mathematician might come along and add all kinds of interesting stuff. Also, addition has non-mathematical meanings, eg. Colour Addition (as opposed to Colour Subtraction, light is one type, ink is the other, i can't remember which is which though). I don't think there is anything wrong with it having it's own page, there is no problem with it taking up too much space in the database, is there? -- <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tango.html" title="Tango">Tango</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>No, database space isn't an issue. I have no objection to keeping it separate if it it could be useful. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say it's easier to join it together later than it is to separate it, so we may as well keep it separate until someone comes up with a good reason for joining them. -- <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tango.html" title="Tango">Tango</a></dd>

<dd>I agree with Angela that policies require discussion and consensus. Stubs have been kept over an objection and RfD by Netoholic, so I think consensus says that they should stay. I also think that the template should automatically add the article to the stub category, rather than having to add it manually. This would add all articles with a stub tag to the category, which is a very good thing, since at the moment the category is empty except for a subcat. I am going to <b>boldly</b> make that change, and if someone later disagrees, they can <b>boldly</b> revert. I just hope they have a good reason and aren't going against consensus. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 00:55, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My apologies. My description of the situation was somewhat incorrect. There was no RfD by Netoholic, but there were two conversations on <a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia%7ESimple_Talk_254e.html" title="Wikipedia:Simple Talk">Wikipedia:Simple Talk</a> in which Netoholic strenuously objected to the existence of stubs. He has also removed the category tag from the template three times, despite the fact that each time it was added by a different person and in spite of the conversation on Simple Talk. I think this is an example of Netoholic deciding what he thinks is best and doing it in spite of what other people think. If he/she does not want to use stubs, Netoholic does not need to, but that should not stop others from using stubs if that is the way they want to work. Isn't that part of the way Wikipedia is supposed to work? We need all kinds of people who act in good faith here, both those who like stubs and those who don't. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 21:16, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
