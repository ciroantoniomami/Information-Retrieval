<p>The reclining Buddha statue from which Bouddha Bar derives its intentionally misspelled name seems to define the leisurely vibe of this laidback lounge near Houhai. At first glimpse, the milieu appears mish-mashed, but the mix of band posters, alcohol advertisements and traditional statues that adorn the walls represent the three themes of this bar: drinking, dancing and divinity.</p>
<p>A lakeside seating area furnished with overstuffed suede sofas offers patrons a place to plop down, kick back and watch boats drift to and from a nearby dock. After 10pm on weekends, they can move inside to a stage-side seat to clap along with the live and lively flamenco and Latin music performances.</p>
<p>The stage features a modest but mood-setting lighting system and a crisp-sounding speaker set-up. Movers and shakers can sashay their way to a small space in front of the stage that sometimes serves as a dance floor, while those who want to sit it out can catch the show from the plump sofas, wicker chairs and hardwood stools that line the stage. <a href="http://www.beijingxiezilou.com" class="external text" title="http://www.beijingxiezilou.com" rel="nofollow">北京写字楼</a> A dimly lit couch-filled room on the far side of the stage offers a more intimate setting for conversation and seems to be the only space where traditional Eastern dcor doesn't cohabitate with generic Western-style tavern ornamentation. Those who don't want to get too far away from the alcohol can snag a stool in the bar room, where they can belly up to the bar or kick it at the foosball table. <a href="http://www.xiezilouxinxi.com" class="external text" title="http://www.xiezilouxinxi.com" rel="nofollow">写字楼</a> Boozers who like to mix it up can customize their drink orders by matching the type of alcohol they deem most potent with the mixer they consider most potable for 20 yuan a glass. The less inventive can select from Bouddha's list of house specialty drinks, which have names that come straight from the men's locker room. Local brews cost 20 yuan while imported beers are 35 yuan a bottle.</p>
<p>Bouddha Bar might not be the best place to find enlightenment in Beijing, but after meditating over several beverages at this temple of tipple, things do become a bit more Zen.</p>

<p>The tone of this wiki is absolutely patronising, and does not serve a purpose. Interestingly, as having discussions about this with people around me, it seems that only the English speaking community sees this wiki having value. For foreign people the concept turns out to be quite a blunder.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There may be more foreign readers later when there are more good pages. Many people may read these pages and not write anything. Some people may be able to read simple English but writing it is too hard for them. So we don't know how many people use these pages. Even if there are no foreign readers, only children, some deaf people and people who do not easily understand Statistics, and some other people, it will still be good. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 14:44, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is like pig-latin, not a proper language. Unfortunately the case seems to be that this wiki stays, as this already has over 10,000 articles. It seems that only the numbers matter, not so much going for the quality (which is pretty good in other wikis).</p>

<dd>Simple English is a pidgin or something like a pidgin. It is not a full, natural language.

<p>Paradoxically, the articles written in proper English are far more easy to comprehend than these pigified versions of them. It seems that people go to the English wikipedia, copy an article, come here and pretty much rape the English language to produce a "simpler" version of it. Which is not, of course, what actually happens.</p>

<dd>(After two edit conflicts)First off, we still know who you are, signed or not&#160;:). If you think that this page should be nominated for deletion, nominate it. It will most certainly fail, because people support this project. Also, are you a native english speaker? Because if you are, these articles will sound dumb and pointless. Now, I personally know a bunch of native spanish speakers who are just learning the language, and the english wikipedia is way beyond their vocabulary. They learn things like "door" and "shoe" and "throw" before they learn words like "collaborated", for example. A sentence from the "Acid" article on english: That approximates the modern definition of Brønsted and Lowry, who defined an acid as a compound which donates a hydrogen ion (H+) to another compound (called a base). That doesn't look very easy to translate, in my opinion. Once again, if you genuinely feel that it should be deleted, nominate it. If you want to destroy all the work that people have put into this, please, nominate. We have gotten this sort of comment before. If you are an advanced learner, please, GO TO ENGLISH.

<dd>I have seen one or two things I thought were condescending. The answer is to change those things. I saw something on one of the Main Pages about a SE wiki being for "people learning English". I changed it to "people who do not know much English". Maybe "read" is better than "know". I think it's condescending to assume that everyone using the SE wikis is learning English or wants to learn English. Probably many want to learn English. Some may only want to get the information. Some may be people with a spoken native language other than English. They may or may not want to learn more English than they already know. Some may be Deaf people; some Deaf people have learned a spoken language and some have not. Some want to learn a spoken language and some do not want to. Many Deaf people are not able to easily learn a spoken language or the writing of a spoken language. I would not call being Deaf a learning disability. I think that would offend some Deaf people. Some Deaf people are happy being Deaf and do not want to learn English. The answer is not to delete the whole wiki. The answer is to edit the Main Page and any other place you see condescending things and change them -- but not if you think using BE850 is condescending. If there were Simple Wikipedias in other languages I would probably enjoy reading them. I wuold read them to learn the other languages and to find information and to translate information into the languages I know better. I'm pretty advanced in French so I would probably not look much at a Simple French Wikipedia, but I would not vote to delete it. I might look at Simple French or even Simple English sometimes if I see something I do not understand on the French or English Wikipedia. I think Simple English can be good for native English speakers to understand complex subjects. Or it will in future when it has more good pages. I may translate Statistics pages into Simple English; I think native English speakers will read them. If you have a complaint like "condescending", don't just say that you saw a condescending page somewhere; change the page or talk about which page it was and which words were condescending. Or give an example if there are too many to list. I tried to write this in Simple English. I know that the person I'm answering and some other people reading this are able to read more complex English. I think it's good to write simple English because I think some people reading this may find simple English easier. I'm sorry I used some hard words. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 12:53, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, this project makes no sense to me. The way i view it, teaching someone the term "body water" will complicate the learning process, adding an additional step towards understanding "sweat" whilst throwing in a new piece of data that is effectively useless in communication outside of the SEWikipedia. Additionally, if a person is never exposed to the word "sweat," how are they ever going to know what the word means? If the goal is comprehension, we can see that the brilliance and beauty of wikipedia step in. Any word that is not understood can be linked to, where an entire article is dedicated to explaining that subject. While comprehension may not be very great immediately, that is exactly the essence of the process of learning. I understand correlation is key to understanding, but in terms of humans that correlation is typically through a combination of the information given by the senses, in which case a text database will never be ideal for someone trying to understand (as opposed to parrot). Put simply enough, teach a person in simple terms and you will get a person with a simple mind (for example, look at feral children, which shows that limiting stimulus to a developing mind limits the potential of that mind). We do not have simple minds, we never do. In response to above, "acid" is described in complex terms because it is a complex topic. If your friends were to look up the articles for "door" and "shoe," they would probably be much more likely to understand what is being talked about. They might even be able to expand their knowledge of the language by clicking on the links that are words they don't understand within that article. I speak and read and write english plenty fine, but i still don't understand some articles.</dd>

<dd>I disagree. When I am learning a language I like to read a simple text in the language I am learning. I do not like to go from one language to another every second. Looking in a ____ to English dictionary means looking at another language every time. Learning a language is better if you can stay in that language for many minutes at one time. A phrase like "body water" can help a person stay in the language and understand and not look at another language in that minute. Maybe some people learn well if they go from one language to another every second. Maybe other people do not. Maybe you learn languages easily using a dictionary of two languages, and maybe it is hard for you to understand that some people do not like to learn that way or do not learn well that way. This Wikipedia is for people who know that they like to read Simple English. Many books for language learners use simple text. Also, this Wikipedia is not only for people who want to learn English. It is also for people learning to read, and for some deaf people who may be able to read Simple English but not English, and for people who do not have time to learn English but need information quickly, and for other people who want to read Simple English for many reasons. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 05:01, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

But I would be much more happy if I could find simple text written for adults, about something I want to read about. Learning a language is a pleasure but it is also hard work. It is much easier for me to learn when reading something that is in simple text and is talking about something I want to read about. Books for children are simple text, but frequently they are not very simple. Children know many words. Also books for children are talking about things children want to read about. They are not talking about things I want to read about. Different people want to read about different things. I hope later there will be Simple Wikipedias in many languages with pages about many things. Then I will find the pages about things I like to read about. I will have much pleasure reading them and learning a little of the languages. After a person has learned a little of the language, if they want to learn more they can read hard words. It is much easier to find hard words. Now there is Wikipedia in many languages so it is very easy to find hard words about many things in many languages. That is also very good for language learners. Some people may learn better by starting with hard words, but they do not need to delete the Simple English Wikipedia which is for the people who learn better by starting with simple text, and is for people who cannot learn English or do not have time to learn English or do not want to learn English and cannot find information in any other language they can read -- some people cannot easily read any language. We do not delete wheelchairs just because for most people it is healthier to walk. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 14:01, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Almost all Simple English does not sound like "body water". Yes, maybe teaching "body water" will make learning more complex. Teaching "body water" is not very good. But almost all Simple English is much more like English than "body water" is. The reason "body water" can be good is that someone can understand "body water". Saying "body water" is not for the purpose of teaching English. It is for the purpose of helping the reader understand. The rest of the page can be for teaching English because the rest of the page probably sounds like English. Saying "body water" makes the person stay and understand and read the rest of the page, and get information or learn English. Maybe the person just wants to get information and does not want to learn English. Maybe the person is learning English but looking in a dictionary that tells the meaning of "body water" in another language makes it hard for the person to learn English because they start to think in the other language. For some people that makes it difficult to learn a new language. So it is good for the language learner to see "body water" and think in English. And it is good for the person who wants information and is not trying to learn English, if they can understand "body water" but can't understand a harder word. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 14:19, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The ideal version doesn't, but on the SE WP, yes, it does. EN WP articles are mutilated in the process of conversion into "simple" English that is actually harder to understand. I've made this point many times (not here, though): People learn languages by being <i>exposed</i> to that language, not to some mutilated version that as pointed out above only adds another step to the learning process AND creates another <i>language</i> - the SE WP language - that those who are trying to learn English and come to the SE WP have to learn. Using the "body water" example - unfortunately, I think those who object to the statement that similar "simple" English is present on the SE WP are missing the point. Things like "body water" <b>are</b> present on the SE WP. Look, for example, at the Main Page: "the free encyclopedia that anyone can change". "Change" implies a more fundamental change, a change in the <i>characteristics</i> of this wiki, not a change in the content of any articles. Besides, the SE WP is inconsistent: if "change" is better, why not "change summary"? "Change history?" Sounds weird? My point exactly. And on the editing screen: how do you "try a test"? Is a test something that can be tried? That is an obvious redundancy. Such examples of mutilated "English" are abundant in the SE WP.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree that not everyone will be able to follow the content in the EN WP, but mutilating it makes it worse. A random list of some mutilated English on the SE WP:</p>
<ul>
<li>To try a test</li>
<li>Support Wikipedia (does not always refer to monetary support; I can tell everyone I know about Wikipedia three times a day, and I will still be supporting it - just not financially.)</li>
<li>All substitutions of "change" for "edit" on the SE WP (see above)</li>
<li>Occurrences of "difficult" words on the SE WP. This is just a plain contradiction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Etc. The SE WP is to me just plain misguided. Bad English has to be distinguished from simple English, but the very nature of this project defeats that. The SE WP attracts (or is supposed to attract) editors/users with a weak command of English. Editors contribute at their own level, <i><b>including editors with a weak command of English</b></i>. Therefore, it follows that such articles will have bad English (if I am being too direct here, I apologise, but I'm not very good at indirect conversations). When more editors with a weak command of English start editing the article, the result is more bad English. In the end, all the bad English accumulates and the page swells the ranks of the pages needing cleanup...again. --218.186.9.5 15:10, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

It is protected against editing by new accounts and IP's (a user must be at least 4 days old to edit it), and it can only be moved by someone with sysop status (admins and above). The partial protection prevents drive-by trolls while allowing almost all editors equality when dealing with issues on the page that needs to be corrected (mainly this would be moving a wiki from one classification to another - we don't get a lot of edits needed for the main page.. ).
