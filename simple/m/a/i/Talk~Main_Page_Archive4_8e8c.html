<p>This Simple English for language learners ... I mean, why not to do it properly? Nobody wants to use this sort of crap (sorry for the profanity) as a learning tool. It seems that the contributors and regular writers undermine and underestimate the readers. It's like considering them retarded. I am not a native English speaker, quite far from it actually. My British friend who moved to my home country (which is irrelevant, but I might say it because my language is considered the 2nd hardest after Japanese (subjective)) for sure wouldn't enjoy a similar Simple Finnish wikipedia ... Damn! This idea is great! Let's have <b>a Simple version for every language</b> in the wikipedia project! Simple Navajo, Simple Swedish, Simple Russian, Simple Whatever!</p>
<p>Whose idea was this Simple Wikipedia in the first place? This is embarrassing! I hope the discussion would encompass to discuss the future direction and the whole future of this part of wikipedia. I wish this to be put under reconsideration.</p>
<p>Addon: I might bring something useful to this mess, as I am here anyways. In the mainpage you say "Biggest Wikipedias", well, as a foreigner I would see it much more logical if it would say "Largest". Considering our brainless readers know the word "Large" and prefer it before "Big". Biggest? What the heck.</p>
<p>Presumably most of the Simple English writers are native Englishmen and women, who have no idea of teaching languages anyways. Put somebody doing better guidelines and put someone in charge!</p>

<p>I only recently found Simple English Wikipedia and I for one am very impressed by it. Wikipedia is all about taking knowledge and making it accessible to as many people as possible. Language can be a barrier to that and Wikipedia has been committed to breaking that barrier since the creation of the very first non-English wiki. Simple English is the logical extension of its 229 sisters and works toward the exact same end. That Wikipedia tries to effectively serve even those with learning difficulties, weak backgrounds in the language, or who just find traditional Wikipedia plain old confusing should not be a cause for embarrassment but a mark of pride; Wikipedia continues to distinguish itself from other intellectual endeavors in terms of accessibility. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TonyJoe" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TonyJoe" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TonyJoe</a></p>

<p>The introduction to this part of wikipedia makes little sense</p>
<p>'Keep it simple - then pages will be easier to read by people who do not speak English well. Write good pages - The best encyclopedia pages are full of detail and information on the subject. '</p>
<p>Simple and detailed are opposites of each other, which is it?</p>
<p>Also what is the goal of this wikipedia exactly? On here there are arguments about whether its for children or for foreigners, the children one is discredited with a wikijunior thing whilst for the foreigners- can't they go read their language's wikipedia?</p>

<dd>I'm guessing you've never needed to speak a foreign language before. It can be quite difficult. I think that the simple English pages are here to allow many people who speak only a little English to contribute to a shared encyclopedia. It is not here to teach people to speak English.</dd>

<dd>Also, I think the person who made the first comment in this section is choosing not to think. "Keep it simple" means the language must be simple. "Full of detail" means that the articles should have a lot of information. A great deal of information can be written in very simple language.--69.143.244.79 03:09, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am a native Russian speaker and your "Simple English" does not seem any bit easier for me. I cant even see the difference. And whats the purpose of these stupid comments on the main page for such international words as <i>biology</i>, <i>geography</i>, <i>architecture</i> and so on? These words are understandable for anybody. I think if a person can understand this wikipedia, he of course will understand the conventional English one. The most difficulty in learning English is not international words, but English-specific ones and grammar. --213.141.159.52 06:39, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Q) Is there a list of words that should be used here? Stuff is very difficult to find here. Plus it's very difficult to find a place to ask such a question...</p>
<p>A) While I don't know about a prescribed list, there are a number of useful lists. One that is widely known and used in English language teaching is Michael West's General Service List of about 2000 words. There are existing tools, such as Tom Cobb's Compleat Lexical Tutor &lt;<a href="http://www.lextutor.ca/vp/eng/" class="external free" title="http://www.lextutor.ca/vp/eng/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lextutor.ca/vp/eng/</a>&gt;, which will identify these words if you to paste a text in. Other's include the Oxford 3000, which can be downloaded from &lt;<a href="http://www.oup.com/elt/catalogue/teachersites/oald7/oxford_3000/oxford_3000_list?cc=gb" class="external free" title="http://www.oup.com/elt/catalogue/teachersites/oald7/oxford_3000/oxford_3000_list?cc=gb" rel="nofollow">http://www.oup.com/elt/catalogue/teachersites/oald7/oxford_3000/oxford_3000_list?cc=gb</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>hi anonym, you find that stuff is very difficult to find here? it's false: stuff is very difficult to find in all the world! it is so... and if you will help to make stuff more accessible, then come the trolls and say "you don't have to give here indications how to find ressources about basic english. it is only possible to name the source and give her ISBN numero! not more..."</p>
<p>anonym, old books have no ISBN numero. it is so. only a few number of reprints make in far east (for basic english). the most have today no ISBN numero... a completely idiot situation: you know, you will transmit but wikipedia's trolls say NO and erase your work or "revert the page" so that you will never find your work again and your page is as erased.</p>
<p>but to your question:</p>
<p>i find there are to much "simple English" versions. in this case, it would be better to use directly pidjin English...</p>
<p>if this division of wikipedia has to have a reason, it is necessary to decide a standard and in my opinion it can be only Basic English or VOA-English. both are historical standards. the rest is only "better pidjin English". for different reasons ("British American ...") would be VOA-English to American for me. I would say only Basic English can be right!</p>
<p>on the Basic English site you can find the original list of the 850 words of Basic English (see please <a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/words.html" class="external free" title="http://ogden.basic-english.org/words.html" rel="nofollow">http://ogden.basic-english.org/words.html</a> ). in special pages (for ex. about "bible" or religions, "sciences" etc.), it is possible to use the extensions you will find on the Basic English site at <a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/intlword.html" class="external free" title="http://ogden.basic-english.org/intlword.html" rel="nofollow">http://ogden.basic-english.org/intlword.html</a> .</p>
<p>if you do so, the reader experimented in basic english will never need to open his "The General Basic English Dictionary" to understand you!</p>

<p>Hi anonymous2, this is the guy from the question "List of allowed simple words?" again. I guess it speaks for itself that you make fun of me staying anonymous while not giving your name away... my name is Mark, by the way&#160;:-) So, is this "Ogden Basic English list" the official list of allowed terms?

<p>What were you thinking when you decided to unprotect the main page? It wasn't a good idea because I just found this sexually offensive edit to the main page from 11 December 2004. The edit went:</p>
<p><i>Removed (strong language and sexual references would cause Internet content filters to be activated) - if you wish to see the edit, look at the history of the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarknew_cf59.html" title="User:Marknew">Marknew</a></i></p>
<p>I laughed at it, but I shouldn't really because it's not cool to make stupid edits, or for that matter, let people make these edits. You're just opening yourselves up to vandalism by unprotecting your main page. That example of vandalism could have been why your page was protected in the first place, and you, probably not having even gone to school, decide to unprotect it? <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Gall_cc1f.html" title="User:Scott Gall">Scott Gall</a> 11:15, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What made you unprotect the main page anyway? It's usually protected for a reason. I agree with the fact that protected pages might be - or actually are - considered harmful, but if it's the main page, it should be protected if you've had enough of the vandalism.

<p>Keep it simple - then pages will be easier to read by people who do not speak English well.</p>
<ol>
<li>"keep it simple" is a slang term. How is slang easier to read by people who do not speak english well?</li>
<li>How does one's speaking of English affect their ability to <b>read</b> English?</li>
</ol>
<p>It is a statement about keeping things easy to understand, and that statement is in and of itself difficult to understand, making a slang reference and a logically fallacious assertion--that those who cannot understand wikipedia cannot do so because they do not <b>speak</b> English.</p>
<p>Here is a better suggestion: "Use simple words to make pages easier to understand for visitors who do not read English well." You can even replace "understand" with "read" if you like, but I am averse to using the same verb twice in a sentence.</p>

<p>Hello, and I found here that a way of categorizing articles is a bit strange, compared to normal English Wikipedia site. For example, Category:Everyday life does NOT make sense to me.

<p>the present definition does seem valid, as civilization does necessarily involve artifacts, but the "study of civilization" is really the last step of archaeology,</p>

<p>I support the creation and development of Simple English Wikipedia for the same reason cited above by Davidc. When one is beginning to learn a new language, one of the best ways to study is to read, read, read. Reading becomes much more effective and much less frustrating if one can find help on the way to fluency, such as books, magazines, and articles written for those who are new to the language or those who have difficulties with the language. Children's materials simply do not do the job for an adult who needs to learn to understand adult-level ideas in a foreign language.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that even in countries where the primary language spoken is English, many government agencies and bureaus must provide materials, pamphlets, public health information, etc. in English written at a third-grade level; that is, so that a person with only an elementary education can understand it. This is because very, very many people who speak English, even as a first language, are functionally illiterate or have difficulty understanding material written on a high school level or a college level.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the material should be directed at a child audience, because the primary audience IS made up of adults who may well be capable of grasping adult-level ideas, even if some of those adults have learning difficulties. Rather, it means only that we should make the conveyance of those ideas -- the language -- as simple and straightforward as possible without sacrificing critical content.</p>
<p>The main problem that I find here is, indeed, the poor English or 'baby talk' found in several articles and even on the main page. Such language is unsuitable even for children, and Simple English Wikipedia should have an adult audience.</p>
<p>I want to suggest that the main page of English Wikipedia should contain a prominent link to the Simple English Wikipedia, and vice versa. I did not know that Simple English Wikipedia even existed until a Google search turned it up, deep in later pages of the results.</p>
<p>Also, I think the most common spelling is 'archaeology,' not 'archeology,' although both are technically correct.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some cool thoughts. I also suggest, that if the front page maintains the use of the British English "maths" instead of "math" (a moderately ugly Americanism, in my opinion), then it should retain the use of the British English "archaeology" instead of "archeology".

Despite that, these pages should look like an intelligent wikipedia articles but in simplified and easy to read language. Should also avoid insulting children's book type reading.

<p>I am a native Russian speaker and your "Simple English" does not seem any bit easier for me. I even cant get the difference. And what the purpose of these stupid comments on the main page for such international words as biology, geography, architecture and so on? These words are understandable for anybody. I think if a person can understand this wikipedia, he of course will understand the conventional English one. Most difficulty in learning English is not international words, but English-specific ones and grammar. For example, understanding the word <i>people</i> is more difficult than <i>anthropology</i>. If you learn Russian, what would be more easy for you - <i>antropologia</i> or <i>nauka o ludiakh</i>? --213.141.159.52 06:51, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Simple English is beneficial. Not everyone who speaks English as a second language is European. A Chinese person would not find "anthropology" easier than "people." They would more likely have learned "people" first. People also speak English at different levels - perhaps our commentators above are more advanced. Furthermore, children can also benefit from simple English. 24.64.223.203 09:00, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>I have been looking through the articles and noticed that they are all very short. Even the George W Bush article is less than a page. I have added a section on Iraq, but I am still curious.

<p>Why do you default to the American spelling for words where there are two versions? If you want to continue to do this I suggest you rename the wiki to the 'American English' wiki. I have even found 'British English' on one of your pages! Are you suggesting that because there are variations on Spanish, the Spanish language should be redundantly tagged as 'Spanish Spanish'? This site as it stands will help people learn American English, not English. So do one or the other, be consitent, andmost importantly, be consitent with your stated aims. Either you want people to learn English, or American English. Sure, put alternate spellings of either English or American English, but if you want English spellings to be the alternative, then you really should rename this wiki to 'American English'.</p>

<dd>Spelling differences should be explained in the articles themselves, not in the names of articles. We won't tolerate renaming articles in this way.

<dd>My ha'p'orth: There is "English". And there are varieties of English. Two such varieities are the two most important standards of English worldwide (arguably). These are General American English and (Standard Southern) British English. These two standards are fairly similar. What's the big deal? Who cares if "colo(u)r" has a "u" in it in one article, and without in another. Seriously: what difference does it make? One standard, the other, a mix of the two, it really makes no difference at all to anything.&#160;:) Bryan 82.44.212.6 00:01, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A lot of people have been criticizing Simple English as being patronizingly simple or using poor sentence structure. These criticisms aren't entirely fair, since they are made by people who speak English at a much higher level than those who would benefit from these pages. At least one critic seemed to assume all non-English speakers all spoke European languages. As far as sentence structure goes, unfortunately an encyclopedia written by lay people isn't going to have great grammar - in any language.</p>
<p>In order to address the 'patronizing' element, we need to remove language from the main page that seems a bit childish. "Wikipedia in more languages" on the regular English main page says "Wikipedia in other languages." "Other" is preferably grammatically, and is a pretty simple word. And "biggest," "lots of," and "fewer" articles could easily be "with over 100,000 articles, etc." just like regular English Wikipedia. Makes it seem that we think people who read other languages don't understand numbers.</p>
<p>For clarity, I suggest in the top left box, "here" instead of "at this place." And maybe "web sites" rather than "places," since it may not be clear that a web site is a <i>place</i> (depends on the connotation of <i>location</i> in one's culture). Also, I think "good pages" should be "useful pages." 24.64.223.203 05:53, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I've already said, 24.64.223.203, I wholly agree with you about the redundancy of "here at this place", not just because it sounds "patronizing" (I'll use your word, I can't think of another off the top of my head, though maybe just plain "wrong" would suffice)..</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And there's really no harm in including any words outside our language's wordlist <b>as long as</b> they're hyperlinked to a decently written Simple English article. Isn't that the whole point of this place? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobo192_c260.html" title="User:Bobo192">Bobo192</a> 08:12, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I definitely agree with changing the "other languages" section back to numbers, which are self-explanatory. Biggest, lots of, and fewer are not simple, they're simplistic. Even a child, seeing "over 100,000 articles," may not know how many that is, but he or she knows it is a very big number. I also agree with Bobo192 that other words shouldn't be a problem as long as they're linked, I just think the link should be to Simple English Wiktionary, where I feel all simple definitions belong. If there isn't an entry there for the word you want to use, <i>make one</i> (what a concept!). --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 03:31, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really can't figure it out. People who don't speak English well enough to understand the English Wikipedia can simply read the page in their own language. No one wants to read articles written like this; it's painful, and entirely useless. All this page does is contribute to the decay of the English language, which is already bad enough as it is. Oh and about those comments saying everybody doesn't speak a European language, citing Chinese as an example, someone who speaks Chinese can simply use the Chinese Wikipedia which contains about 55 000 articles, almost 8 times as many as this page. So, once again, no useful purpose.</p>

Speakers of minority languages like Basque, Catalan, etc. would be better served by a Simple Spanish wiki (even the normal Spanish wiki would almost certainly be more helpful than this to them) because it is their country's dominant language and they'd be much more likely to know some of it than English. Britain and America have very few minority languages spoken by a fairly large group that doesn't also speak English. Your third point shouldn't, at least, be accurate - <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">even the Simple English Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. And as to your fourth, maybe so, but why no consideration for similarly literate French, Germans, Spaniards, etc.? This is quite frankly a vanity project, pretty unlikely to be useful to anyone, and it reflects poorly on Wikipedia as a whole. -70.130.139.249 22:31, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you don't like Simple English, why not read something else instead? Some people are willing to volunteer to put it together, though they are imperfect in doing so, and some people may read it. If there's no Simple Spanish, etc., it's only because no one has decided to start it. If someone wants to do so, then I guess it will exist. In the meantime, if anyone wants to make use of these pages, why complain? People learning basic English who wish to practice reading, children, people with learning disabilities, and people who speak languages that don't have these articles but know a little English, any of these people might read it. There's a lot of people volunteering to do this, and you're calling it a vanity project. The tone of the critic(s) on this page suggests a need to vent a little. Simple English isn't an affront to anyone. Why not leave us alone and edit some other page? 24.64.223.203 05:56, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I object to this Wiki's existence because it's like having a Pig Latin Wikipedia - it has no real use and hurts Wikipedia's attempts at being recognized as a serious encyclopedia. Wikipedia is not a place to learn a new language, and the topics that children or people with learning disabilities would be likely to research aren't things like quantum physics; they would probably be topics like "dogs" which have articles on the normal English wiki that are very readable. The tone of much of this Wikipedia is such that even a child would likely feel spoken down to, anyway. This Wikipedia is a poor idea with even worse execution. Things like "Mechanics is one part of physics. It says what happens when forces act on things. There are two parts of mechanics. The two parts are classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. Classical mechanics is good most of the time. It is good to say what happens about most things we can see. Some of the time, for example when the things are too small, classical mechanics is not good. Then we need to use quantum mechanics." are not useful to anyone, and there are examples far worse than that one. -70.130.222.105 08:26, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Responding to Blockinblox, actually, whether or not the "Wikipedia is not a dictionary" policy applies here is still under debate (for example, see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_79ff.html" title="Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not</a>). For my own stance, I think that following precedence and putting the dictionary entries in Simple English Wiktionary is the best idea, but mine is only one voice. We'll see how things turn out. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 03:19, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we should have a section at the bottom of the page with links to other Simple English sisterprojects (SEWiktionary, SEWikibooks, SEWikiquote), and below that a part that links to other English sisterprojects (English Wikipedia, English Wiktionary, English Wikibooks, English Wikinews, English Wikisource, English Wikispecies).

<p>Should English have its own subcategory, perhaps "Very Big Wikipedias"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Interesting question. I object to the term "real English," as if simple English were only imaginary or something. A much better phrase would be "1,000,000 articles on English Wikipedia." However, in answer to your question, even though English Wikipedia could be put in a separate category, I think it is better to leave it where it is. I just don't think it is necessary. If we leave it as it is, the title of the section still applies, even if we use numbers, since it is still above 100,000 articles. When there are two or three Wikipedias in that larger category, it would certainly be a useful change. Of course, I don't feel very strongly about this, and a new section would be logical, so if someone really wants to make the changes, I say go for it! --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 23:53, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It was mentioned earlier on this page that we should use numbers of articles on other Wikipedias, rather than descriptions, since that makes it seem like we think if people can't read English well, they can't read numbers well either. I commented there, but I'm going to make a new comment here on the same theme. I think it makes much more sense to use numbers. Numerals of any kind (Arabic, Roman, even hexadecimal) are not English. They are numbers, which are accepted and recognized internationally and interlingually. Therefore, people whose first language is not English will have even less problem understanding that section if the information includes numbers than if we keep it only in words. Even children can tell when a number is very big. Plus, this would be following precedent. I am not for following precedent blindly if there is a very good reason not to, but when there is a very good reason <i>to</i> follow it, it seems like a no-brainer to me. Therefore, if after a few days there is no strong opposition, I'm going to boldly make the change. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 23:53, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that an article of the week would be helpful because it would show people some articles that they may not have known about before and may learn from or be able to contribute to. I know this topic has been raised before, and the consensus was that there weren't enough articles; there are upward of 8000 articles now.

<dd>I support this idea. Even though the vast majority of those 8000 articles are stubs, I'm sure there are still plenty of well-done articles to have one each week.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm not writing a perfect English, but I just wanted to tell anybody actually working on that Simple English stuff that I found 100% of the 30 articles or so I've read so far extremely poorly written and useless in terms of info. It seems you don't want to make a Wiki for children, but I wonder who could get any piece of valuable and serious info on Napoleon, for instance, on that page: <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> which is a children-dedicated piece of very little interest. How come nobody ackownledges this here, given the high amount of bad comments you seem to get on this discussion page?</p>
<p>It sounds like the whole project actually IS aimed at children and I find it very dishonest to even try to make us believe it's not. Moreover, I find it extremely patronizing to imagine that a person who doesn't understand English well (not to mention the previously spotted mistake of the former formulation "doesn't speak well", which only proves the writer of the sentence has no clue about writing / reading / understanding / translating /languages or linguistics as a whole...) should NEED this kind of poor project to learn a language. There are teachers to do so. You are no graduated teachers, and the way most of you write doesn't allow you to even apply for the position. So a bit of modesty here, instead of that vanity, is needed.</p>
<p>This site is a very self-indulgent project and it certainly brings Wikipedia down, IMHO.</p>

<dd>Abandon it. WP:NOT should include "Wikipedia is not an English 101 textbook." The purpose of an encyclopedia is to present information, not to teach people how to play basketball, do calculus, fight fires, or learn a language. It makes no sense to have an encyclopedia greared towards teaching English, period. Even if it did make sense, reading encyclopedia articles isn't a very good way to learn a language. For several years I have been learning Spanish, and I've never had a Spanish professor suggest to me that I start reading random articles in an encylopedia. I read textbooks that teach grammar and talk to native speakers of Spanish to practice. That's the way to learn a language. --68.239.114.50 23:25, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously neither Mr. Mons nor the user at 68.239.114.50 (if they are not the same person) understand the point of this Wikipedia. This Wikipedia is not to help people learn English. It is not an English 101 textbook. It is an encyclopedia, created to provide information to people who know little English, for any reason. Because it is directed towards those who know little English, a selected set of English words is used. People may use this encyclopedia to learn English, but that is not its purpose. Many articles are still stubs because this project is still early in its growth (despite the number of articles). For more on this project's purpose, audience, etc., see the discussion <a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia%7ESimple_talk_51fd.html#Project_direction" title="Wikipedia:Simple talk">here</a>. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 19:49, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I mean seriously. Why would someone who doesn't speak this language even want to look up encyclopedia articles in another language. I speak very little spanish that I learned in school, so it's not like I'm going to go to the "Simple Spanish" wikipedia just to look up an article that is probably in the english wikipedia! --<a href="../../../../en/g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeMoney_583b.html" class="extiw" title="en:User:GeorgeMoney">en:User:GeorgeMoney</a> - <a href="../../../../en/p/n/e/Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis.html" class="extiw" title="en:Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis">en:Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis</a> 06:55, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>THE MOST DIFFICULT THING IS: PHRASAL VERBS. DON'T USE THEM SO MUCH!!!!!!!!! TRY TO USE LATIN WORDS, EASY TO UNDERSTAND FOR FRENCH, SPANISH, PORTUGESE, ITALIAN, SOUTH AMERICAN PEOPLE, OR TRY TO SAY THINGS IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

<p>I'm happy with the idea of simple English, but really now, can we <i>please</i> at least do the bare minimum of proper grammar? "I", when referring the first person, is <i>always</i> capitalized. Lower-case "i"'s are associated with children and the illiterate. Perhaps these are a target audience, but they are not representative of the people who are creating the content here. We should not sacrifice accuracy for aesthetics in any instance. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 19:21, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with aflm, as I said in a comment earlier on this page. Though English Wikipedia has over a million articles, I don't think it is worthwhile to start a new category until there are two or three Wikipedias in that category, and the current designation is still true in any case. Not starting it yet also avoids looking English-centric. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cromwellt_f6b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cromwellt">contris</a> 23:00, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You know the effort put into this parallel world will have to copy the whole of the English language Wikipedia in condensed form, don't you? All that will drain effort from the main idea, as far as I can see. If you can read you can read the "real" Wikpedia. And everyone who uses it and then wants to learn English properly will have to learn it all twice. The whole thing puzzles me. Why bother? 80.0.36.84 12:38, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
