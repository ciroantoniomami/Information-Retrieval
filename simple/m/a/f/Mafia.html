<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Edit section: The Italian Mafia in America">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Italian Mafia in America</span></h3>
<p>The Italian-American mafia began at the time when many Italians moved to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> in the <a href="../../../1/8/0/1800.html" title="1800">1800s</a>. The first Italian mafia was in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> but soon they were in many cities across the country. The Italian mafia in the United States is actually called <i>La Cosa Nostra</i> which in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian language</a> means "This thing of ours" or "Our thing". The American mafia is divided into different groups or "families".</p>

<li>The Colombo crime family</li>
<li>The Gambino crime family</li>

<p>There are many other groups like the Italian mafia all over the world. Here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Yakuza</b> - <i>The Yakuza</i> is the name given to the crime group in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. They make money from prostitution and drugs. The Yakuza have many thousands of members all over the world but mostly in Japan.</li>
<li><b>The Triads</b> - <i>The Triads</i> is a name given to all the crime groups in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>. Because there are so many of these crime groups in China we give them one name, the "Triads". The Triads are not just from China but many countries in South East <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>. Another name for these groups is "Tongs".</li>
<li><b>The South American Drugs Cartels</b> - In <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a> the largest crime groups are called drug cartels. They compete for control of the drug trade which makes them huge amounts of money. The drugs produced in South America are <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana.html" title="Marijuana">Marijuana</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">Cocaine</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">Heroin</a>.

</ul>
<p>There are others aswell, like the mafia groups in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> that make money from drugs and weapons. All these groups operate in the United States, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> and other Western countries and cause many problems in those countries and the countries they are from.</p>
<p><a name="Hierarchy" id="Hierarchy"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Edit section: Hierarchy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hierarchy</span></h2>
<p>Just like in a company, where you have a <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boss.html" title="Boss">boss</a> and you have <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worker.html" title="Worker">workers</a>, the Italian-American mafia, or La Cosa Nostra (LCN), has a <b><a href="../../../h/i/e/Hierarchy.html" title="Hierarchy">hierarchy</a></b>. Everyone has a job to do. Some people are bosses and some are workers. Below is the hierarchy of an American mafia family.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>The Boss of the family</b>. He controls everything that goes on in the mafia family. Every worker and lower ranking boss (<i>see below; Caporegimes</i>) works for him. It is the boss who decides if someone should be killed or if someone should be initiated (<i>see below; Becoming a member</i>). The boss gets money from all of his workers and therefore is usually the richest person in the family.</li>
<li><b>The Underboss</b>. The underboss is the person who actually runs the family. He is boss over all the other members except the actual boss. He will often become the boss of the family if something happens to the boss. The boss will choose who his underboss is. A family will usually have only one underboss.</li>
<li><b>The Consigliere</b>. Consigliere is an Italian term meaning someone who gives advise. The consigliere in a mafia family is the "right hand man" to the boss. It is his job to help the boss make important decisions. The consigliere is as important as the underboss but is not the boss of anyone in the family. A family will usually have only one consigliere.</li>
<li><b>Caporegimes</b>. The next position of the family is caporegime (or captain). Families will have different numbers of caporegimes. A caporegime is in charge of a group of workers (<i>see below; Soldiers</i>). The underboss of the family is in charge of the caporegimes. The job of the caporegime is to collect money from the workers to give to the boss, underboss and consigliere aswell as keeping money for himself. A family can have anywhere from 2 to 20 caporegimes.</li>
<li><b>Soldiers</b>. The workers of a family are called "soldiers" or in Italian "soldati". There job is to earn money to give to their captain (caporegime). They will do any job asked of them by their captain or the boss or underboss. A family can have anywhere from 10 to 300 soldiers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each family will have a number of associates. These are people that work with them or for them but are not official members. (<i>see below; Becoming a member</i>)</p>
<p><a name="Becoming_a_member" id="Becoming_a_member"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Edit section: Becoming a member">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Becoming a member</span></h2>
<p>To become a member of an Italian-American mafia family you have to be Italian or have Italian parents. Only males can become members. Usually you have to have killed somebody to become a member. Members of the mafia start off as 'associates' working for the mafia.</p>
<p>After working for the mafia as an associate you might be asked to join as a 'member'; this is how it happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>A caporegime, if he knows of a hard-working associate, will ask the boss and the underboss if the associate can become a member. And if the boss agrees that the associate is a hard-worker he may become a member.</li>
<li>The associate will then be taken to a secretive place by the caporegime, the underboss and other members; sometimes the boss.</li>
<li>Here he will be asked to promise that he will never tell anyone about the family or about any crime commited by other members of the family. He must promise to give a portion of the money he earns to his caporegime and to follow the rules of the family.</li>
<li>He will then have his finger pricked with a pin, and be given a card with a picture of a <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint.html" title="Saint">saint</a> on it. This card will be folded and set on fire in his hands. This is part of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tradition.html" title="Tradition">tradition</a> of the mafia.</li>
<li>After this is completed he is a member and he will be assigned to a caporegime - possibly the one he was working for before when he was an associate.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Edit section: History of the Mafia in New York">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History of the Mafia in New York</span></h2>
<p>The mafia in New York began when thousands of Italians moved there in the late <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">1800s</a> and early <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">1900s</a> to find a better life. At this time many <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germans</a> also moved to the US for the same reasons. Many of these people set up <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business.html" title="Business">businesses</a> or worked for businesses that were already there. Most earned very little money and some, who were tired of being poor, decided to earn money from crime, which was easier than earning money by working. There were many Irish and Italian criminal groups in the city who would steal, extort and murder for money. These groups were known all-together as "the Black Hand" but they didn't actually work as one group called "the Black Hand"; there were many groups and they each worked on their own and the term "Black Hand" actually was the name of what these gangs did (extortion), not their names.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> (or liquor) was made illegal in the US and the gangs had a new way to make money. They brought in illegal liquor from <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and sold it in clubs. They bribed police into letting them sell liquor (which is also illegal) and made millions of dollars from this because they were the only ones who had liquor and so could sell it at extremely high prices. Around this time the gangs in New York became one large gang (the Mafia) as leaders of the gangs realized that more money could be made if all the gangs worked together. A man named Giuseppe Masseria and a man named Salvatore Maranzano both wanted to become the boss of the newly made New York mafia.</p>

Giuseppe Masseria</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Fighting, known as the "Castellammarese War", broke out between the two men and many of their soldiers were killed. Giuseppe Masseria's underboss was a man named "Lucky" Luciano who also wanted to control the New York mafia. He met with Masseria's enemy Salvatore Maranzano and plotted to kill Masseria, his own boss. Masseria was shot to death in a restaurant in New York by Maranzano's soldiers; one of them was Vito Genovese - a man who would later become boss - this was also the end of the "Castellammarese War". With the death of Masseria, Maranzano appointed himself the boss of the New York Mafia, in Italian language called the "Capo di tutti Capi" meaning "Boss of all Bosses". He called a meeting with the other "mafiosi" (<a href="../../../p/l/u/Plural.html" title="Plural">plural</a>: Italian language for Mafia members) from all over the US and made the rules that are still used today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maranzano united the Italian gangs of New York into one gang, known as the Mafia or La Cosa Nostra.</li>
<li>He then divided the gang into 5 families and appointed bosses of each family: "Lucky" Luciano, Joseph Bonanno, Joseph Profaci, Vincent Mangano and Thomas Gagliano - himself as the boss of these bosses.</li>
<li>He made it so that no members could kill without reason or talk to anyone outside of the mafia about the mafia.</li>

Meyer Lansky</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The bosses of the five families, particularly Luciano, began to grow tired of Maranzano's <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrogance.html" title="Arrogance">arrogance</a> and the way he ran the mafia. Maranzano realized this and planned to have Luciano and his "consigliere" and "underboss", Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, as well as others, killed. Maranzano did not act quickly enough and was killed by men dressed as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_officer.html" title="Police officer">police officers</a>, on the orders of Luciano and his friend, a Jewish gangster from <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> named Meyer Lansky. Luciano then became the head of the New York mafia, but not in the way Maranzano was; he helped the five families run their business but he did not control them or call himself the "boss of bosses". The five families were kept.</p>
<p>The Profaci family (named after the first boss Joseph Profaci) went on to become named the Colombo crime family after a later boss, Joseph Colombo. The Mangano family (named after the first boss Vincent Mangano) went on to become named the Gambino crime family after a later boss, Carlo Gambino. The Gagliano family (named after the first boss Thomas Gagliano) went on to become named the Lucchese crime family after a later boss, Gaetano Lucchese.</p>
