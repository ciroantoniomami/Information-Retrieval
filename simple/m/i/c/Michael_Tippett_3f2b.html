<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Tippett_3f2b.html" title="Edit section: Life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Life</span></h2>
<p>Tippett spent his childhood in a small <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village.html" title="Village">village</a> in <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffolk.html" title="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>. His father had retired and had bought a <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotel.html" title="Hotel">hotel</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannes.html" title="Cannes">Cannes</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. Michael and his brother learned to speak <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> when they were very young. He was sent to school in <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> when he was 13 but did not like it there so he went to the local Stamford Grammar School in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincolnshire.html" title="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>.</p>
<p>The only musical training he had as a child were his piano lessons. When he had finished his school years he decided he wanted to be a composer, but neither he nor his parents knew the best way to become a composer. He started having more piano lessons. Then someone said he should go to the Royal College of Music. He went there at the beginning of the summer term, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> and spent five years there studying music. He then moved to Oxted in <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey.html" title="Surrey">Surrey</a> and for six years he taught French at a school. He composed in his free time.</p>
<p>In Oxted there was a small choir. Tippett had sung with them while he was a student. Now he became their conductor and he learned a lot about music by getting the choir to sing English madrigals and other music including <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">operatic</a> music. He took some more lessons in composition from R.O.Morris at the RCM. He went to music camps where he learned more ideas about <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a> than about music. He agreed with a lot of the ideas of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotsky.html" title="Trotsky">Trotsky</a>. He became a pacifist and in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> he registered as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscientious_objector.html" title="Conscientious objector">conscientious objector</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> he spent three months in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">prison</a> because he refused to help with the war effort.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Tippett had become director of music at Morley College. He made the choir there into one of the best choirs in England. He played a lot of music by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Purcell_9056.html" title="Henry Purcell">Henry Purcell</a> whose music was not as well known then as it is now. He also worked with young musicians who later became famous: the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenor.html" title="Tenor">tenor</a> Peter Pears, the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Countertenor.html" title="Countertenor">countertenor</a> Alfred Deller and the Amadeus String Quartet.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a> he became a broadcaster with the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>. Some of the talks he gave on the radio were published in his book <i>Moving into Aquarius</i>. He continued a brilliant career as composer, conductor and broadcaster. He was director of the Bath Festival which he helped to improve a lot. He became internationally famous, especially in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">America</a>. His <i>Symphony no 4</i> and his oratorio <i>Mask of Time</i> were written for performances in America. His last opera <i>New Year</i> was written jointly for the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston.html" title="Houston">Houston</a> Grand Opera, Glyndebourne and the BBC. He was made a CBE in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> and was knighted in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> and was made a Companion of Honour in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> and received an Order of Merit in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. He received many honours from universities.</p>
<p>Tippett died from <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> after travelling to <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockholm.html" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> for a festival which included all his works except his stage works. Although he was able to return home he died shortly afterwards.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Tippett_3f2b.html" title="Edit section: His music">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">His music</span></h2>
<p>It is unusual for a great musician to begin studying music properly at the age of 18. However, he was old enough to realize that he had a lot to learn. He studied <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterpoint.html" title="Counterpoint">counterpoint</a> and was influenced by the way <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_music_period.html" title="Classical music period">Classical</a> composers had shaped their music. <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beethoven.html" title="Beethoven">Beethoven</a> especially was an inspiration for him. One of his best-known works is the <i>Concerto for Double String Orchestra</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>). It shows his love of <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_music.html" title="Folk music">folk music</a> as well as interest in English music of the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. This music is exciting because of its beats, which keep changing, and its dance-like character.</p>
<p><i>A Child of our Time</i> was an oratorio which used negro spirituals. He combined these with his own style of music. It is about something that really happened in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>. A 17-year-old <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Polish</a> boy killed a <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> diplomat because the Nazis had taken away his parents. The Nazis were angry and killed lots of Jews in return. It was something which helped to lead to the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Tippett’s music is about the cruelty that humans show towards one another.</p>
<p>Tippett’s operas include <i>A Midsummer Marriage</i> (started 1946, first performed 1955), <i>King Priam</i> (1958-61), <i>The Knot Garden</i> (1966-69) and <i>The Ice Break</i> (1973-76) and <i>New Year</i> (1989). He wrote several choral works. His orchestral works include 4 <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony.html" title="Symphony">symphonies</a>, a <i>Fantasia concertante on a Theme of Corelli</i> for strings (1953), a <i>Piano Concerto</i> (1953-55) and a <i>Concerto for <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violin.html" title="Violin">violin</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/o/Viola.html" title="Viola">viola</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cello.html" title="Cello">cello</a></i> (1979). His chamber music includes piano sonatas and string quartets.</p>

<p>Tippett published many of his writings. <i>Moving into Aquarius</i> consists of talks given on the BBC. In his <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography.html" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a> <i>Those Twentieth Century Blues</i> he discusses many of his problems, including his <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, which in his earlier years he could not talk about because it was <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegal.html" title="Illegal">illegal</a> at that time.</p>
