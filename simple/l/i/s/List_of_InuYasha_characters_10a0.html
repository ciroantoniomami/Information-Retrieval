<p>InuYasha is the male hero of the series. He is a half-<a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demon</a> ("han'y≈ç" in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_language.html" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a>). His <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father.html" title="Father">father</a> was a demon and his <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother.html" title="Mother">mother</a> was <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a>. He uses a <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapon.html" title="Weapon">weapon</a> called the Tessaiga. It is a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernatural.html" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a> <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword.html" title="Sword">sword</a> that is made from one of his father's <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teeth.html" title="Teeth">fangs</a>. This sword can <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill.html" title="Kill">destroy</a> one hundred demons with just one swing. InuYasha can heal very fast and can recover from <a href="../../../i/n/j/Injury.html" title="Injury">injuries</a> which would kill for any average human. InuYasha <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">loves</a> Kikyo but things get less simple when he starts to have feelings of love for Kagome.</p>
<p><a name="Kagome" id="Kagome"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_InuYasha_characters_10a0.html" title="Edit section: Kagome">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kagome</span></h3>
<p>Kagome is the girl main character of <a href="../../../i/n/u/InuYasha_60e6.html" title="InuYasha">InuYasha</a>. She is the <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a> of Kikyo and lives in the future part of the well. She was a normal girl until her 15th birthday, when Sota, her brother said that Buyo, their <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat.html" title="Cat">cat</a>, had gone missing into the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple.html" title="Temple">shrine</a> that had the well inside it. Kagome stepped near the well when Mistress Centipede's bones came alive and pulled Kagome into the well. The bones had felt the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikon_no_tama.html" title="Shikon no tama">shikon no tama</a> inside Kagome that Kikyo had with her when she was killed. Mistress Centipede tried to get the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewel.html" title="Jewel">jewel</a> in the water when Kagome pushed Mistress Centipede with her hand. The hidden jewel suddenly showed through Kagome's hands. It cut one of the centipede's arms.</p>
<p>The centipede <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demon</a> went away and Kagome landed on the floor of the well. She climbed up the well - now in the past - to see a place she did not see before, because it was the past. But she knew the tree that Inuyasha was <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seal.html" title="Seal">sealed</a> in by Kikyo's arrow 50 years ago. It was the tree near her house. She ran up to it. That was the first time she met Inuyasha. When the village people found her and took her to Kaede, the village's <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priestess</a> realised that Kagome's the reincarnation of her sister, Kikyo. The priestess helped Kagome keep the jewel in her house in the village.</p>
<p>But the centipede demon was not gone. It attacked the village to get to Kagome and the shikon no tama. Kagome ran towards the well. Kaede had said the well would be pure (good) enough to keep Mistress Centipede away. Kaede realised then that Kagome has <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priestess.html" title="Priestess">priestess</a> powers like Kikyo and herself because Kagome can see things only priestesses can, like the light from the well. Kagome was caught by Mistress Centipede at a tree where Inuyasha was stuck. Kagome freed InuYasha by pulling out the arrow. Inuyasha helped <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill.html" title="Kill">kill</a> the demon after being freed, but wanted to attack Kagome as well to get the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikon_no_tama.html" title="Shikon no tama">shikon no tama</a> inside her.</p>
<p>Kaede made a spell that whenever Kagome says "sit!" then Inuyasha would fall over, so that Inuyasha would listen and not attack anymore. Kaede also says that Inuyasha and Kagome had to work together to find the shikon no tama which broke after Kagome shot it. That is why they go together on the adventure. In the adventure, she makes a lot of friends.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Normal Life</dt>
</dl>
<p>Kagome knew by episode 4 that she could go from the past to her own time, where she has to work as a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student.html" title="Student">student</a> in her school. This is why she is always seen wearing her uniform. Many people like her in any time: for example, Hojo likes Kagome in the school, and Inuyasha and Koga likes Kagome in the past time. Kagome is sometimes confused because she has tests to do, but she doesn't have much time to practice. Most of the time she goes to the past to help Inuyasha to find the shikon no tama - that is why she does not have much time - and her grandfather makes up funny stories on why Kagome does not go to school, and Kagome usually gets angry about that.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Kikyo and Kagome</dt>
</dl>
<p>Kikyo, when she got alive again, tried to run away from Kagome because she was scared that Kagome would take away her <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a>. She thought that because Kikyo was alive only because of half of Kagome's soul, which Kagome could easily take away and control. But when Kikyo liked Inuyasha again, she was jealous of Kagome, but got over it. Kagome was still jealous of her even so. That does not mean that Kagome did not like to help Kikyo. Kagome helped many times. Kikyo herself also gave Kagome her <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priestess.html" title="Priestess">priestess</a> powers, together with the power to shoot arrows.</p>

<p>Miroku is a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a> or a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk.html" title="Monk">monk</a> who likes pretty women. He always asks them if they could have his child. He has a <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse.html" title="Curse">curse</a> on him called <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wind.html" title="Wind">Wind</a> <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunnel.html" title="Tunnel">Tunnel</a>, made by <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naraku.html" title="Naraku">Naraku</a>. Naraku changed his shape into a pretty woman so that Miroku's <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandparent.html" title="Grandparent">grandfather</a>, who also liked women, would come to Naraku. It was a <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trick.html" title="Trick">trick</a> to give him the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse.html" title="Curse">curse</a>. Wind Tunnel or Air Void is when Miroku can suck <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demons</a> in with his right <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hand.html" title="Hand">hand</a>, just like a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html" title="Black hole">black hole</a>. He uses it to fight than thinking that it's a curse, but it is a curse because if he keeps using it and, if he waits for a long time without having a <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son.html" title="Son">son</a> to pass the Wind Tunnel on, he will get sucked into his own Wind Tunnel, which grows bigger every time. He wants to <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenge.html" title="Revenge">revenge</a> on Naraku for the curse and when he meets Kagome, Inuyasha and Shippo, he goes with them.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Relationship with Sango</dt>
</dl>
<p>He meets Sango when she attacks Inuyasha, because she thought Inuyasha was the one who ruined the village. Miroku feels sorry for her at first, and makes Inuyasha wait until Sango gets well. But when Sango is <a href="../../../h/e/a/Healing.html" title="Healing">healed</a>, then Miroku's lechery (<a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">loving</a> of women) comes back and he always tried to touch her back. He never asks her to <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear.html" title="Bear">bear</a> his child though, and thinks Sango as a partner until episode 132, where he <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proposal.html" title="Proposal">proposes</a> to her to marry her and bear his child when Naraku is destroyed. Sango agrees, and asks him if this means that he will not <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cheat" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cheat" rel="nofollow">cheat</a> on her again, but Miroku never answers.</p>

<p>Kirara is Sango's pet <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demon</a> who is very loyal to her <a href="../../../p/o/s/Possess.html" title="Possess">owner</a>. She is a nekoyokai (a cat-demon in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese.html" title="Japanese">Japanese</a>) and even if she is one of the <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">major</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/Character.html" title="Character">characters</a> who doesn't come a lot like Shippo, she is still a clever demon who helped Midoriko, and <a href="../../../u/n/d/Understand.html" title="Understand">understands</a> Sango's <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emotion.html" title="Emotion">feelings</a> about Kohaku. She met Inuyasha and his friends before Sango, because she was still left in the village when Sango went away to fight the demon, which attacked the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle.html" title="Castle">castle</a> <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord.html" title="Lord">lord</a>'s house.</p>
<p>Kirara can turn from a cute, lovable small cat to a fierce big <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger.html" title="Tiger">tiger</a>-like cat. She comes to like Shippo mostly from Inuyasha's friends.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_InuYasha_characters_10a0.html" title="Edit section: Sango">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sango</span></h3>
<p>Sango is a <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demon</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:slay" class="extiw" title="w:en:slay">slayer</a>, also called yokai tajiya in Japanese. She lived with her father and brother, with her job as killing bad demons and collecting the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikon_no_tama.html" title="Shikon no tama">shikon no tama</a>, messed with darkness because of the badness of the demons who had it. She would give the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewel.html" title="Jewel">jewel</a> to those who could purify it, like Kikyo.</p>
<p>But everything went wrong in episdoe 24, where her brother, Kohaku, finally becomes a demon slayer himself for the first time. They go on his first work with the other slayers (his families) including Sango, when Kohaku acts very strangely. After <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill.html" title="Kill">killing</a> the demon they were ordered to, by a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle.html" title="Castle">castle</a> lord who looks at how all the slayers are doing, Kohaku uses his <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapon.html" title="Weapon">weapon</a> to kill all of his families except for Sango. Sango finds out that the castle lord, <a href="../../../p/o/s/Possess.html" title="Possess">possessed</a> by a spider demon (meaning a demon went inside him to control him), who used spider webs to control Kohaku. Sango is upset, trying to kill the castle lord when Kohaku attacks her on her back. She falls down, with Kohaku, because the castle lord orders for the guards to attack the <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibling.html" title="Sibling">siblings</a>. Kagewaki Hitomi, the prince of the castle <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill.html" title="Kill">kills</a> his own possessed father, the lord, to show that he was being controlled by a demon. Everyone makes a <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burial.html" title="Burial">burial</a> for the poor, dead slayers.</p>
<p>Naraku was really planning this to happen, possessing the castle lord, so that he could call his friend demons, who wanted to <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenge.html" title="Revenge">revenge</a> on the slayers, to come to the slayers' village to ruin it. Naraku then tells Kagewaki Hitomi that Inuyasha had done it. Sango, still alive, and in treatment of the prince, comes out of the house to say that she is ready to fight Inuyasha, and revenge on him. But when she finds out that Inuyasha's a kind demon, and Naraku was the one who <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betrayal.html" title="Betrayal">betrayed</a> them, she joins Inuyasha, Kagome, Shippo and Miroku to revenged instead on Naraku, who they are all wanting to find. Sango has a <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet.html" title="Pet">pet</a> called Kirara.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Sango has many weapons because she's a slayer, but she usually uses Hiraikotsu, the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boomerang.html" title="Boomerang">boomerang</a> made by the bones of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demons</a>.</li>
<li>Y≈çkai Paralyzing <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poison.html" title="Poison">Poisons</a> (ÊØíÂàÜ, dokufun): Sango knows a lot about poisons, and she helps Inuyasha at times with it. She also wears a <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas.html" title="Gas">gas</a> <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mask.html" title="Mask">mask</a> so that poisonous gas wouldn't come to her.</li>
<li>Dagger <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glove.html" title="Glove">gauntlet</a>: Hidden in the <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleeve.html" title="Sleeve">sleeve</a> of her dress is a dagger she can pull out easily.</li>
<li>Katana: She sometimes uses this if she loses Hiraikotsu.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/h/a/Chain.html" title="Chain">Chain</a>: She uses this as a <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whip.html" title="Whip">whip</a> and make enemies not come to her.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Relationship with Miroku</dt>
</dl>
<p>Miroku is a monk, who likes many women, and asks all of them to have/<a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear.html" title="Bear">bear</a> his child. He never asked that to Sango even so. Sango feels for Miroku, but Miroku doesn't seem to show it, and keeps on asking women the same thing. Sango is <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jealousy.html" title="Jealousy">jealous</a> every time and hits him with her Hiraikotsu or slaps him on the face if Miroku tries to touch her back.</p>
<p>Sango and Miroku usually work together with their own weapons. Miroku has the Wind Tunnel and Sango Hiraikotsu. Miroku agrees that he finds Sango as a partner to work with.</p>
<p>But in episode 132, Miroku <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proposal.html" title="Proposal">proposes</a> to Sango and saying if she could bear his child when they kill Naraku, for the first time, and Sango agrees, crying.</p>

He wants to steal the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikon_no_Tama_9ca0.html" title="Shikon no Tama">Shikon no Tama</a> from Kagome and Inuyasha when he finds them, so that he can have enough power to <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenge.html" title="Revenge">revenge</a> on the Thunder Brothers. He has the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power.html" title="Power">power</a> to turn into different shapes, and so turned into a large, pink ball that he usually turns into, to scare them off, but Inuyasha just wins over him, laughing at him for being stupid. Kagome feels for Shippo even so, and <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order.html" title="Order">orders</a> Inuyasha to "Sit!"</p>
<p>But when Shippo gets to steal the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewel.html" title="Jewel">jewel</a>, when he is alone with Inuyasha and makes a heavy stone to go on Inuyasha's hand, Kagome follows him to find him caught with the Thunder Brothers. Kagome is also kidnapped soon after, and Inuyasha comes to save the two of them.</p>
<p>He soon wins over the Thunder Brothers, who had the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corpse" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corpse" rel="nofollow">corpse</a> of Shippo's father for their <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sash" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sash" rel="nofollow">sash</a>. Because the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a> of Shippo's father still wanted to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protect.html" title="Protect">protect</a> Shippo, the fox-fire saved Kagome and Shippo when they are in the fire made by one of the Thunder Brothers. Shippo, because he didn't have anywhere to go, he follows Kagome and Inuyasha on their adventure. Shippo can also make a small, blue fox-fire like his father. He seems to care about many young girls of his age, for example Satsuki, his first <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">love</a>.</p>
<p>He also likes Kirara, Sango's pet demon they met at episode 24. Shippo means <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven.html" title="Seven">seven</a> treasures in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese.html" title="Japanese">Japanese</a>.</p>

<p>Naraku is an evil demon made by Onigumo, who <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">loved</a> Kikyo. When Onigumo became <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jealousy.html" title="Jealousy">jealous</a> of Inuyasha, he made many demons, led by a spider demon, come to him with his impure (bad) mind of jealousy. This is because demons like bad minds. The spider demon tells Onigumo that if Onigumo wants <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenge.html" title="Revenge">revenge</a> on Inuyasha, he has to let the demons eat his <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a> and join with him to fight off Inuyasha. When Onigumo agrees, Naraku is created. Naraku has a heart made out of Onigumo's soul, which still loves Kikyo. But Naraku is evil because many demons joined him, just like the demons made by Midoriko's lover, and kills Kikyo while <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pretence" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pretence" rel="nofollow">pretending</a> to be Inuyasha. This is so that Kikyo would think the real Inuyasha killed her. Naraku did this to get the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikon_no_tama.html" title="Shikon no tama">shikon no tama</a> for himself, and didn't want Kikyo to hand it to Inuyasha.</p>
<p>Kikyo <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seal.html" title="Seal">seals</a> Inuyasha because of this, when Inuyasha runs away with the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikon_no_tama.html" title="Shikon no tama">shikon no tama</a> because Naraku also turned into Kikyo to say things to hurt Inuyasha, who thought it was the real Kikyo. Thinking that Kikyo wouldn't give him the shikon no tama as promised, he steals it. Kikyo thinks then that Inuyasha is <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betrayal.html" title="Betrayal">betraying</a> her so she shoots an arrow at him.</p>
<p>Nobody knows about Naraku until episode 15, where Miroku tells Inuyasha and Kagome about a demon who gave a <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse.html" title="Curse">curse</a> called Wind Tunnel on him. Naraku really gave the curse to Miroku's grandfather, who thought Naraku was a real woman since Naraku turned into a woman to fool the grandfather. The curse has to go on until they win against Naraku. This is how Miroku joins in.</p>
<p>Naraku also tells the other demons in episode 24 to attack a village where no demon <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/slay" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/slay" rel="nofollow">slayer</a> are left, because Naraku controlled Kohaku, a demon slayer, to kill the rest of the slayers. Sango, Kohaku's sister, who is still alive tries to kill Naraku who attacked her village. This is how Sango joins in.</p>
<p>Basically, Naraku is the reason why everyone met each other... they are also planning to kill him as well as finding the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikon_no_tama.html" title="Shikon no tama">shikon no tama</a> that broke into pieces. Naraku is also trying to gather the pieces so that he can become a full <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demon</a>, because he's a half-demon and half-human since with Onigumo, a human, joined with demons.</p>

<dt>Detachments</dt>
</dl>
<p>As well as being able to change into different people, Naraku can also make parts of his body come apart (detach) from him. They are usually called his <b>detachments</b> or <b>incarnations</b>. He made many of them including Kagura, Hakudoshi, Akago and Musou. Akago and Musou were to make himself not like Kikyo anymore because of Onigumo.</p>

She tells both of them that Kagome can see the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikon_no_Tama_9ca0.html" title="Shikon no Tama">Shikon no Tama</a> unlike other people, and because Inuyasha cannot see the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewel.html" title="Jewel">jewel</a> but is strong enough to fight for it, they can work together.

<p>Kikyo was a girl <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a>, also called <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priestess.html" title="Priestess">priestess</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">miko</a>. She was <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse.html" title="Curse">cursed</a> to <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">die</a> if she <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">loved</a> someone. She did not think she was a normal person because of her priestess <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power.html" title="Power">powers</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit.html" title="Spirit">spiritiual</a> powers). She thought that she did not belong anywhere normal. InuYasha, a half-<a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demon</a>, and half-<a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> also did not belong on any side and wanted to become a full demon, just like Kikyo wanting to become normal. This is why Kikyo felt the same as Inuyasha. Because of this they came to love each other. After they both loved each other, Kikyo promises to Inuyasha that she will give him <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikon_no_tama.html" title="Shikon no tama">shikon no tama</a>, which she has to look after (which she also is a priestess for), if Inuyasha uses it to become a full human instead of a full demon. This would make Kikyo normal again, because she's not a priestess any more and Inuyasha her also normal, human husband.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/a/r/Naraku.html" title="Naraku">Naraku</a>, an <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil">evil</a> demon made by <a href="../../../o/n/i/Onigumo.html" title="Onigumo">Onigumo</a>, loved Kikyo and was <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jealousy.html" title="Jealousy">jealous</a> of InuYasha. Naraku could change his <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shape.html" title="Shape">shape</a> into different people. He wanted the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewel.html" title="Jewel">jewel</a> that Kikyo had, the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikon_no_Tama_9ca0.html" title="Shikon no Tama">Shikon no Tama</a>. The jewel would free him from Onigumo's orders (heart) telling him not to kill Kikyo. In the beginning of story, Naraku turned into Inuyasha and talked to Kikyo. Next, he turned Kikyo and talked to InuYasha. He said things that hurt them. He did this to make them <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate.html" title="Hate">hate</a> each other. Kikyo nearly died because Naraku turned into Inuyasha and attacked her.</p>
<p>Urasue, a doll-maker, made a <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay.html" title="Clay">clay</a> doll that looked just like Kikyo. She made it to give Kikyo half the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a> of Kagome, Kikyo's <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a>. Kikyo and the doll are the same people so the doll-Kikyo would have the same soul. Kikyo <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill.html" title="Kill">killed</a> Urasue and ran away from Kagome. She had found out that Kagome would control the soul inside her so that it might go back inside Kagome. She hates Inuyasha too, because before she died, she hated him. She became jealous of Kagome because of Inuyasha liking both her and Kikyo but she got over it soon. Kagome was still jealous of Kikyo - even though they are the same person.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">Death</a></b></p>
<p>Only in the manga, Kikyo dies because she did not go well on destroying Naraku. She tried to <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill.html" title="Kill">kill</a> him by using her arrows to purify (make it good) the finished, whole <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikon_no_Tama_9ca0.html" title="Shikon no Tama">Shikon no Tama</a> when it was with Naraku, because Naraku could not win over pure (good) things and the jewel, when it was complete, would be make the purity even more powerful with its own power. Kikyo hoped that the side of Miroku's soul would win over the evil, demons' souls inside the jewel, but Naraku was too strong for the goodness. He attacked Kikyo with his badness, because he didn't have a heart that <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">loved</a> her any more and Kikyo's messed up goodness of her heart made her <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit.html" title="Spirit">spiritual</a> powers go away. This is why she <a href="../../../d/i/e/Die.html" title="Die">died</a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episode.html" title="Episode">episode</a> ends with Kikyo dying after Inuyasha <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kiss.html" title="Kiss">kisses</a> her. She wishes that Kagome would not cry, because she is happy since her <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a> can rest from living a doll-like <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life.html" title="Life">life</a>. But Kagome does cry. Sango is also sad because she knew that Kikyo cared for <a href="../../../k/o/h/Kohaku.html" title="Kohaku">Kohaku</a>, her brother, and would do anything if she could not <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill.html" title="Kill">kill</a> him.</p>

<p>Midoriko was a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priestess</a> who was so strong that she was the same as 100 of <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> soldiers called <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Samurai">Samurais</a>. She had 4 pure (good) <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">souls</a> inside her: Aramitama (<a href="../../../c/o/u/Courage.html" title="Courage">Courage</a>), Nigimitama (<a href="../../../f/r/i/Friendship.html" title="Friendship">Friendship</a>), Kushimitama (<a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisdom.html" title="Wisdom">Wisdom</a>) and Sakimitama (<a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">Love</a>). The souls could make a person very powerful which was why she was so.</p>
<p>One day, a human who loved her was <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jealousy.html" title="Jealousy">jealous</a>, just like Onigumo. He made <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demons</a> eat his soul so that they could all join together. But the number of demons were so much that the human lost his love and the demons were able to fight Midoriko without any struggle. Because there were so many of them joined together, with so much impurity (bad powers), even with Midoriko's own power of goodness and purity, they could easily win over Midoriko. But when they were about to eat her, she tore out her own 4 pure (good) souls and joined it with the demon's bad soul. This made the demons <a href="../../../d/i/e/Die.html" title="Die">die</a> and made the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikon_no_Tama_9ca0.html" title="Shikon no Tama">Shikon no Tama</a>. But Midoriko also died because of this, together with the demons.</p>
<p>There was a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statue.html" title="Statue">statue</a> of her in a cave in Sango's village where Shako, Sango's <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandparent.html" title="Grandparent">grandfather</a> found the Shikon no Tama for the first time and gave it to Kikyo to look after.</p>

<p>Onigumo is a human who was once a thief. He got beaten and was nearly <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill.html" title="Kill">killed</a> when Kikyo came to save him in a cave. This is how Onigumo comes to <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">love</a> Kikyo, but he is soon jealous. He is the maker of Naraku and because his soul is still inside Naraku, Naraku can not kill Kikyo with the love for her by Onigumo still inside him. Naraku doesn't want to love Kikyo, so he tries to tear onigumo apart. Naraku's trying is shown by Musou, his detachment, who failed. But he finally manges it by tearing his heart, as a little child called Akago and nearly <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill.html" title="Kill">kills</a> her with tentacles, but Kikyo gets help from the soils from Onigumo's cave, where he once used to get treated by Kikyo.</p>

He could also use Hiraikotsu, which is given to <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sango.html" title="Sango">Sango</a> when she is born. He found the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shikon_no_Tama_9ca0.html" title="Shikon no Tama">Shikon no Tama</a> messed up with impureness (badness) because of the bad Mistress Centipede having it. Shako <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill.html" title="Kill">kills</a> Mistress Centipede with his <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boomerang.html" title="Boomerang">boomerang</a> and puts her bones into the Bone-eater's well, where bones of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead.html" title="Dead">dead</a> <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demons</a> are put inside. This is why Mistress Centipede became alive from her bones and grabbed Kagome inside the well. Shako then gives the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewel.html" title="Jewel">jewel</a> to Kikyo, because her goodness will not mess up the jewel any more. But that is why Kikyo has to be a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priestess</a> forever, because she has to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protect.html" title="Protect">protect</a> the jewel forever. She didn't want to stay being a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priestess</a> and wanted to be normal. This is why she agreed to meet Inuyasha and give the jewel to him.</p>
