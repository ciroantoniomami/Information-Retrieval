<pre>
  i am redeaming myself. NO!!!! whenever i hear Wolfj talk about Mrs. Doubtfire, i just roll my eyes.but i am giving it a second chance. i use to hate the movie because Wolfj always talks about it. but now i am reconcidering, know that i have seen the movie for myself,it is sooooooooooooooooo funny!!
  it is based on a man that is being divorced by his wife. he then has 100 days to find a job and a home. his wife is trying to hire a nanny to help take care of the kids. her husband gets the number and makes prank phone calls saying stuff like "I don't work for the males, i use to be one". finally he calls and he gets the job under the name Mrs.Doubtfire. he goes to his gay brither to get a diguise. the movie goes on with many things happening.Until at the end the wife finds out that that her nanny was her ex-husband, because he was supposed to be both the nanny and the husband, and he got the costumes mixed up. it is the best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hey Wolfj, guess what? i am not logged on! i heard you told on me alright, i am sorrey, not!</p>
<p>^ Gracker is annoying, eh? ___________________________________________</p>
<p><br />
I see you got my message, but lets say i was visiting and i forgot to log in and since i am in the school you are in, i wanted to get you excited to think that i am in your school.-Gracker</p>
<p>Jared! I have new news on Gracker. I have sources who know who HE is. I had to give up my poem for the Poetry Contest, but it is worth it. Here is what I know: It is a he and he isn't in High School or 8th Grade. That limits it down to about 179. I'll tell CJ.</p>
<p><br />
So, trying to hide everything you said about me eh? i already enformed Netoholic that you are trying to cover up for everything you wrote about my names being Ben and Andy. Who are these people anyway? you guys did not even apologise to me anyway. i know Turcottem said it was both of you but i want an apology <i>from</i> you not Turcottem's word, until then, you are not getting an apology from me.</p>
<p>Jared, Gracker has agreed to forgive you if you foregive him. By the way check out my talk page or Gracker's. I wrote a new addition.</p>
<p>New here, the name's Gatorite. I deleted your friends article. it was gay. tell your little friend jonesc that mako sharks are the dullest things ever to write an article on. adios. ~Gatorite~</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>JARED! I have news! The English Wikipedia now allows the TI Middle School to edit. I'll tell Jonesc.</p>

<p>Wolfj i accept your apology. i see that you are actually are a really nice person. i haven't been answering you because i had some business with someone else(i can give you no details)</p>
<p><br />
the only way to find out my identity is to watch all that is said by all who know about this sight and all that know who i am.-Gracker</p>
<p>I give up, It's so hard keeping this identity, I am giving up in the vandalising department. Gatorite.&#160;:)</p>
<p>I want to be your friend, but i don't want to tell you who I am. Eventually I might, but right now, my identity is a secret. Truce? Gatorite&#160;: )</p>
