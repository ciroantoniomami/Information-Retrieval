<p>Template:Infobox hurricane I was born on March 18, 1991 at 12:37 PM at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York. My family lived in an apartment building at 151-05 Cross Island Parkway (Service Road, not the highway) in Whitestone. At 6 weeks old, I was flown out to Utah for my uncle's wedding. Just as the female minister said "Does anyone object to this marriage?", I let out a giant burp ringing through the whole hall. Everyone burst out laughing even the minister.</p>
<p>At 18 months, I flew out with my parents to Arizona and got to see the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Canyon_2189.html" title="Grand Canyon">Grand Canyon</a>. It was a beautiful sight. At 2 years old, i was able to recognize letters and read as well. My parents were pretty shocked. In 1995, 51 days before my birthday, my sister was born in New York also. 2 months after my sister's birth, my father's company moved to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> and we moved to a little borough called Highland Park. There is was put into a school.</p>
<p>At the age of 5 years, I was able to multiply and divide while in kindergarden. My parents saw me as a growing smart guy. By the age of 7, in second grade, i got a really nasty teacher. During that year, a substitute gym teacher in her 60's, came and played basketball with us. She tripped over a ball and got hurt, badly. Blood was spewing everywhere. I ran to the bathroom nearby and grabbed paper towels to clean up the blood. My teacher showed up and lectured me on what I did was wrong. Is she nuts? Is it wrong to save a woman's life?! One time, i had put enough with her and put down my pencil. I got out of my chair yelling at her, "Stop being nasty or I will punch you into next week!" She was shocked and the principal called my mom, both had trouble not laughing.</p>
<p>By 4th grade, the attitudes of my teachers changed i got to tutor kids not so smart or lucky. I got to join the school band. I even got a "Peer Tutor" award for my teachings. I got it also the next year. My next year, in fifth grade, i got to be in the school spelling bee. I won the bee, by shear luck. In sixth grade, I got to start changing classrooms each period. But sixth grade was when my life started changing, and i started getting bullied like crazy. That was the year i started my singing career.</p>
<p>Seventh grade, the grade I hated the most, because i lost a dear friend of mine a couple months earlier. It must have come with me to the middle school in Highland Park. I had 2 mental breakdowns, the first was a minor one, where i ran around the school crying, soon getting tackled. December 11th, 2003, the day I won't forget. That was the day of the second breakdown. I ran across the whole building including the High School half with teachers and police running after me. I was able to struggle them off until I finally collapsed on a stairwell, hearing the voice of a friend of mine, a sargeant.</p>
<p>After that breakdown, my parents &amp; I decided to leave Highland Park Public Schools, after many years of problem. I was homeschooled for 45 days via NJ laws. Since March 3rd, 2004 to this present day, i have been going to a private school for kids with behavioral problems. I perfer it there than back in public school. I never plan on going back to HPPS.</p>
<p>At the age of 15, my current age, my singing career booms, I still live in Highland Park. In October of last year, I got to go to Utah for the first time since i was six weeks old. I have two loving parents and young bratty sister. That is my life.</p>
