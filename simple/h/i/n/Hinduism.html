<p><b>Hinduism</b> (<b>सनातन धर्म</b>; <i>Sanātana Dharma</i>, roughly Perennial Faith) is thought to be the oldest <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_world_religions.html" title="Major world religions">major world religion</a> still practiced today. It is the first religion to believe in reincarnation and rebirth.</p>
<p>People who believe in Hinduism are called Hindus. They pray in many different ways. Hinduism started at as long ago as 2000 BCE. It is the third (3) largest religion in the world. There are almost 1.05 <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billion.html" title="Billion">billion</a> Hindus worldwide. 96% of Hindus live in India.</p>
<p>According to Hinduism, any kind of spiritual practice [like praying or doing special exercises called yoga] that is followed with faith, love and a hard struggle will help someone be good at doing something. Hinduism encourages tolerance for what other people believe, since worldly systems cannot claim sole understanding of the one True god or deity. The Ultimate truth is expressed as <i>Nirguna Brahman</i>, or God without form, or God without personal attributes. All personal forms of God in Hinduism, such as Vishnu or Shiva, are different parts of God in personal form or God with attributes. Some examples: <i>Saguna Brahman</i>. God's energy is <i>Devi</i>, the Divine Mother. For Vaishnvaites who follow Ramunjacharaya's <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, Devi is <i>Lakshmi</i>, the Mother of all, and who pleads with Vishnu for mankind, who is filled with wrongs and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sins</a>. For Shaivites, Devi is <i>Parvati</i>. For Shaktas, who worship Devi, Devi is the personal form of God to attain the impersonal Absolute, God. For them, Shiva is personified as God without attributes. (please look <a href="http://www.hinduism-today.com/archives/2003/10-12/44-49_four_sects.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.hinduism-today.com/archives/2003/10-12/44-49_four_sects.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more explanation.)</p>
<p>To the Hindu, this idea has been an active force in defining the 'Eternal Dharma.' It has been for Hinduism what the infinite divine Self of <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advaita.html" title="Advaita">Advaita</a> is to existence, remaining forever unchanged and self-luminous, central and pervasive, in spite of all the chaos and flux around it.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Edit section: A brief overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A brief overview</span></h2>
<p>Hinduism rests on the spiritual foundation of the <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedas.html" title="Vedas">Vedas</a>, the <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishads.html" title="Upanishads">Upanishads</a>, as well as the teachings of many Hindu gurus through the ages. Many streams of thought flow from the six Vedic/Hindu schools, Bhakti sects and Tantra Agamic schools, into the one ocean of Hinduism, the first of the Dharma religions. See Schools of Hinduism.</p>
<p><a name="The_Eternal_Way" id="The_Eternal_Way"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Edit section: The Eternal Way">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Eternal Way</span></h3>
<p>"The Eternal Way" (in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> सनातन धर्म, <i>Sanātana Dharma</i>), or the "Perennial Philosophy/Harmony/Faith", is the one name that has represented Hinduism for many thousands of years. According to Hindus, it speaks to the idea that certain spiritual principles hold true for all time, going beyond man-made beliefs, representing a pure <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a> of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consciousness.html" title="Consciousness">consciousness</a>. This consciousness is not merely that of the body or mind and intellect, but of a soul-state above the mind that exists within <i>and</i> beyond our existence, the pure Self of all. Religion to the Hindu is the native search for the divine within the Self, the search to find the One truth that really never was lost. Truth looked for with faith shall give itself in blissful light, no matter the race, or what is believed. Indeed, all existence, from vegetation and beasts to mankind, are subjects and objects of the eternal <i>Dharma</i>. This inner faith, therefore, is also known as <i>Arya</i>/Noble Dharma, <i>Veda</i>/Knowledge Dharma, <i>Yoga</i>/Union Dharma, <i>Hindu Dharma</i> or, simply, the <i>Dharma</i>.</p>
<p>What can be said to be common to all Hindus is belief in <i>Dharma</i>, <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a>, <i><a href="../../../k/a/r/Karma.html" title="Karma">karma</a></i>, and <i>moksha</i> (liberation) of every soul through a variety of moral, action-based, and meditative <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">yogas</a>. Still more basic principles include <i><a href="../../../a/h/i/Ahimsa.html" title="Ahimsa">ahimsa</a></i> (non-violence), the importance of the Guru, the Divine Word of <i><a href="../../../a/u/m/Aum.html" title="Aum">Aum</a></i> and the power of <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Mantra.html" title="Mantra">mantras</a></i>, love of Truth in many manifestations as Gods and Goddessess, and an understanding that the essential spark of the Divine (<i>Atman/<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahman.html" title="Brahman">Brahman</a></i>) is in every human and living being, allowing for many spiritual paths leading to the One Unitary Truth.</p>
<p>An example of the pervasiveness of this paramount truth-seeking spirituality in daily life is the <i>bindi</i>, which is a common marker for Hindu <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women.html" title="Women">women</a>. It symbolizes the need to cultivate supramental consciousness, which is achieved by opening the mystic "third eye." Hindus across the board stress meditative insight, an intuition beyond the mind and body, a trait that is often associated with the ascetic god <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>. Men, too, will bear on their foreheads the equivalent <i>tilak</i> mark, usually on religious occasions, its shape often representing particular devotion to a certain main deity: a 'U' shape stands for <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishnu.html" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, a group of three lines for <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>. It is not uncommon for some to meld both in an amalgam marker signifying <i>Hari-Hara</i> (Vishnu-Shiva indissoluble).</p>
<ul>
<li>Yoga Dharma</li>
</ul>
<p>Hinduism tells about a particular way of life to lead as a Hindu. This is done by way of <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">Yogas</a> (spiritual practices), mainly as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bhakti Yoga (loving devotion)</li>
<li>Karma Yoga (selfless service)</li>
<li>Raja Yoga (meditational Yoga) and</li>
<li>Jnana Yoga (Yoga of discrimination)</li>
</ol>
<p>The way to do all these have been described in the two principal texts of Hindu <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">Yoga</a>: the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhagavad_Gita_08a2.html" title="Bhagavad Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a> and the Yoga Sutras. The <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishad.html" title="Upanishad">Upanishads</a> also contain important texts about yoga.</p>
<ul>
<li>The four goals of life</li>
</ul>
<p>Hinduism believes in four main goals of life. They are <i>kama</i>, <i>artha</i>, <i><a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharma.html" title="Dharma">dharma</a></i> and <i>moksha</i>. It is said that all humans seek <i>kama</i> (pleasure, physical or emotional) and <i>artha</i> (power, fame and wealth), but soon, with maturity, learn to govern these legitimate desires within a higher, pragmatic framework of <i>dharma</i>, or moral harmony in all.</p>
<ul>
<li>The four stages of life</li>
</ul>
<p>In Hinduism, life of a human being is divided into four stages. These stages are called Ashramas, and they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Brahmacharya, the first quarter of life as a bachelor - to be spent in learning, building the body and the mind.</li>
<li>Grihasthya, the second quarter of life as a person with a family, and doing work for livelihood.</li>
<li>Vanaprastha, the fourth phase of life, spent in forests and in meditation.</li>
<li>Sanyasa, the last phase of life, spent without any feeling and attachment to the world.</li>

<p>Relatively little is known about the origins of Hinduism, as it predates recorded history. It has been said to derive from beliefs of the <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryans</a>. The hundreds of faith and beliefs of Dravidians, and Harappans living in the Indian subcontinent, before the Aryans came to India, was combined under the Hindu term during the British Raj. Subsequently <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jainism.html" title="Jainism">Jainism</a>, were also drafted in to Hinduism. Varying ideas of the origin of the <a href="../../../v/e/d/Veda.html" title="Veda">Veda</a> and understandings of whether or not the Aryans were native or foreign to Indian soil can change estimates of Hinduism's age from 4000 to 6000 years.</p>
<dl>

</dl>
<p>Historically, the word <i>Hindu</i> predates the reference to Hinduism as a religion; the term is of Persian origin and first referred to people who lived on the other side (from a Persian point of view) of the Sindhu or <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indus.html" title="Indus">Indus river</a>. It was used as a signifier not only of ethnicity but of Vedic religion as far back as the 15th and 16th centuries by such figures as <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Nanak_1360.html" title="Guru Nanak">Guru Nanak</a> (the founder of <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>). During the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Raj_db3a.html" title="British Raj">British Raj</a>, the term's use was made standard, and eventually, the religion of the Vedic Hindoos was given the appelation 'Hinduism.' In actuality, it was merely a new signifier for a culture that had been thriving for millennia before. See the Hindu (ethnicity) page for more discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Legal Definition of Hinduism</li>
</ul>
<p>In a <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>, Supreme Court of India defined the Hindu faith for legal purpose. The Court's ruling gave a number of conditions to be considered a Hindu for any legal purpose.</p>

<p>According to one view, the caste system shows how strongly many have felt about each person following his or her dharma, or destined path. A perversion, according to many Hindus, of dharma's true meaning, caste plays a significant role in Hindu society, although it is now losing favor and is illegal in India.</p>
<p>In early Vedic periods, the established Brahmins began discriminating against young candidates for priesthood based on caste. This became more ingrained over centuries until social mobility all but became a thing of the past. In spite of centuries of numerous reform movements, notably within Vedanta, bhakti yoga and Hindu streams of Tantra, and reformers, with recent stalwarts like Swami Vivekananda and <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_e9af.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, caste is so deeply ensconced in the Indian consciousness that even Christian converts have been known to separate church meetings for different castes. A number of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> communities have retained caste practices as well. What was first an injunction to living one's <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharma.html" title="Dharma">dharma</a> in surrender to God became an oppressive mandate to surrender to Man. See caste for more.</p>

The non-Vedic schools are called Nastika, or heterodox, and refer to <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jainism.html" title="Jainism">Jainism</a> and Lokayata. The schools that continue to affect Hinduism today are Purva Mimamsa, <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">Yoga</a>, and Vedanta. See Hindu philosophy for a discussion of the historical significance of Samkhya, Nyaya, and Vaisheshika.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the <i>Purva Mimamsa</i> line of thought was to give an upper position to the Vedas. In the long term, this line of thought showed the way to better understanding of the Vedas. <a href="../../../a/d/i/Adi_Shankara_9078.html" title="Adi Shankara">Adi Shankara</a> and Swami Vivekananda followed this line of thought to explain the meaning of Hindu beliefs.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Edit section: Yoga">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Yoga</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">Yoga</a> system is generally considered to have arisen from the Samkhya philosophy. The <i>yoga</i> referred to here, however, is specifically Raja Yoga (or meditational union). It is based on the sage <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patanjali.html" title="Patanjali">Patanjali</a>'s extremely influential text entitled the Yoga Sutra, which is essentially a compilation and systematization of meditational Yoga philosophy that came before. <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishads.html" title="Upanishads">Upanishads</a> and <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhagavad_Gita_08a2.html" title="Bhagavad Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a> are also indispensable literature in the study of Yoga.</p>
<p>The most significant difference from Samkhya is that the Yoga school not only incorporates the concept of Ishvara (a personal God) into its metaphysical worldview but also that it holds Ishvara as the ideal upon which to meditate. This is because Ishvara is the only aspect of purusha (the infinite Divine Ground) that has not become entangled with prakrti (the temporal creative forces). It also utilizes the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahman.html" title="Brahman">Brahman</a>/Atman terminology and concepts that are found in depth in the <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishad.html" title="Upanishad">Upanishads</a>, adopting Vedantic monist concepts. Realization of the goal of Yoga is known as moksha or samadhi. It, like the <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishad.html" title="Upanishad">Upanishads</a>, seeks realization of the Atman as being nothing other than the infinite Brahman through ethical (mind), physical (body) and meditational (soul) practices of one-pointedness on the 'one supreme truth.' See <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">Yoga</a> for an in-depth look at its history.</p>

<p>The Uttara ("later") Mimamsa school is perhaps one of the cornerstone movements of Hinduism and certainly was responsible for a new wave of philosophical and meditative inquiry, renewal of faith, and cultural reform. Primarily associated with the <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishad.html" title="Upanishad">Upanishads</a> and their commentary by Badarayana, the Vedanta Sutras, Vedanta thought split into three groups, initiated by the thinking and writing of Adi Sankara. Most Hindu thought today in some way relates to changes affected by Vedantic thought, which focused on meditation, morality and centeredness on the one Self rather than on rituals and meaningless societal distinctions like caste. See Vedanta for greater depth.</p>

<p>Advaita literally means "not two"; thus this is what we refer to as a monistic (or non-dualistic) system, which emphasises oneness. Its consolidator was Sankara (788?-820?). Sankara expounded his theories largely based on previous teachings of the <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishad.html" title="Upanishad">Upanishads</a> and his own guru Govinda Bhagavadpada. By analysis of experiential consciousness, he exposed the relative nature of the world and established the non-dual reality of Brahman in which Atman (the individual soul) and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahman.html" title="Brahman">Brahman</a> (the ultimate reality) are identified absolutely. It is not merely philosophy, but a conscious system of applied ethics and meditation, all geared towards attaining peace and understanding of truth. Adi Sankara denounced caste and meaningless <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritual.html" title="Ritual">ritual</a> as foolish, and in his own charismatic manner, exhorted the true devotee to meditate on God's love and apprehend truth.

<p>Ramanuja (<a href="../../../1/0/4/1040.html" title="1040">1040</a> - <a href="../../../1/1/3/1137.html" title="1137">1137</a>) was the foremost proponent of the concept of Sriman Narayana as the supreme Brahman. He taught that Ultimate reality had three aspects: Isvara (Vishnu), cit (soul) and acit (matter). Vishnu is the only independent reality, while souls and matter are dependent on God for their existence. Because of this qualification of Ultimate reality, Ramanuja's system is known as qualified non-dualism.</p>

<p>Like Ramanuja, Madhva (<a href="../../../1/1/9/1199.html" title="1199">1199</a> - <a href="../../../1/2/7/1278.html" title="1278">1278</a>) identified god with Vishnu, but his view of reality was purely dualistic in that he understood a fundamental differentiation between the ultimate godhead and the individual soul, and the system is therefore called Dvaita (dualistic) Vedanta.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Edit section: The Bhakti schools">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Bhakti schools</span></h3>
<p>The Bhakti (Devotional) school is takes its name from the Hindu term that signifies a blissful, selfless and overwhelming love of God as the beloved Father, Mother, Child, or whatever relationship finds appeal in the devotee's heart. The philosophy of Bhakti seeks to tap into the universal divinity through personal form, which explains the proliferation of so many Gods and Goddesses in India, often reflecting the singular inclinations of small regions or groups of people. Seen as a form of <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">Yoga</a>, or union, it seeks to dissolve the ego in God, since consciousness of the body and limited mind as self is seen to be a divisive factor in spiritual realization. Essentially, it is God who effects all change, who is the source of all works, who acts through the devotee as love and light. 'Sins' and evil-doings of the devotee are said to fall away of their own accord, the devotee shriven, limitedness even transcended, through the love of God. The Bhakti movements rejuvenated Hinduism through their intense expression of faith and their responsiveness to the emotional and philosophical needs of India. They can rightly be said to have affected the greatest wave of change in Hindu prayer and ritual since ancient times.</p>
<p>The most popular means of expressing love for God in the Hindu tradition has been through <i>puja</i>, or ritual devotion, frequently using the aid of a <i><a href="#Forms_of_worship:_icons_and_mantras" title="">murti</a></i> (statue) in conjunction with the singing or chanting of meditational prayer in the form of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mantra.html" title="Mantra">mantras</a>. Devotional songs called bhajans (written primarily from the 14th-17th centuries), kirtan (praise), and arti (a filtered down form of Vedic fire ritual) are sometimes sung in conjunction with performance of puja. This rather organic system of devotion attempts to aid the individual in connecting with God through symbolic medium. It is said, however, that the <i>bhakta</i>, through a growing connection with God, is eventually able to eschew all external form and is immersed entirely in the bliss of undifferentiated Love in Truth.</p>

<p>Altogether, bhakti resulted in a mass of devotional literature, music and art that has enriched the world and gave India renewed spiritual impetus, one eschewing unnecessary ritual and artificial social boundaries. See bhakti yoga for more.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Edit section: Tantrism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tantrism</span></h3>
<p>According to the most famous Western Tantrik scholar, Sir John Woodroffe (pseudonym Arthur Avalon): "The Indian Tantras, which are numerous, constitute the Scripture (Shastra) of the Kaliyuga, and as such are the voluminous source of present and practical orthodox 'Hinduism'. The Tantra Shastra is, in fact, and whatever be its historical origin, a development of the Vaidika Karmakanda, promulgated to meet the needs of that age. Shiva says: 'For the benefit of men of the Kali age, men bereft of energy and dependent for existence on the food they eat, the Kaula doctrine, O auspicious one! is given' (Chap. IX., verse 12). To the Tantra we must therefore look if we would understand aright both ritual, yoga, and sadhana of all kinds, as also the general principles of which these practices are but the objective expression." (Introduction to Sir John Woodroffe's translation of "Mahanirvana Tantra.")</p>
<p>The word "tantra" means "treatise" or "continuum", and is applied to a variety of mystical, occult, medical and scientific works as well as to those which we would now regard as "tantric". Most tantras were written in the late middle ages and sprang from Hindu cosmology and <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">Yoga</a>. See Tantra for more.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Edit section: Ahimsa and the cow">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ahimsa and the cow</span></h3>
<p>A note of the element of ahimsa in Hinduism is vital to understanding the society that has arisen around some of its principles. While <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jainism.html" title="Jainism">Jainism</a> as it was practiced was certainly a major influence on Indian society, what with its exhortation of strict <a href="../../../v/e/g/Veganism.html" title="Veganism">veganism</a> and non-violence as <i>ahimsa</i>, the term first appeared in the <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishad.html" title="Upanishad">Upanishads</a>. Thus, an ingrained and externally motivated influence led to the development of a large section of Hindus who grew to embrace vegetarianism in a bid to respect higher forms of life, restricting their diet to plants and vegetables. About 30% of today's <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> population, especially in orthodox communities in South India, in certain northerly states like Gujurat, and in many Brahmin enclaves around the subcontinent, is vegetarian. Thus, while vegetarianism is not dogma, it is recommended as a sattwic (purifying) lifestyle.</p>
<p>Those Hindus who do eat meat predominantly abstain from <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beef.html" title="Beef">beef</a>, some even going so far as to avoid leather products. This is most likely because the largely pastoral Vedic people and subsequent generations of Hindus throughout the centuries relied so heavily on the cow for all sorts of dairy products, tilling of fields and fuel for fertiliser that its status as a willing 'caretaker' of humanity grew to identifying it as an almost maternal figure. Thus, while most Hindus do not worship the cow, and scriptural injunctions against eating beef arose long after the <a href="../../../v/e/d/Veda.html" title="Veda">Vedas</a> had been written, it still holds an honored place in Hindu society. It is said that <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krishna.html" title="Krishna">Krishna</a> is both Govinda (herder of cows) and Gopala (protector of cows), and <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>'s attendant is Nandi, the bull. With the stress on vegetarianism (which is usually followed even by meat-eating Hindus on religious days or special occasions) and the sacred nature of the cow, it is no wonder that most holy cities and areas in India have a ban on selling meat-products and there is a movement among Hindus to ban cow-slaughter not only in specific regions, but in all of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>.</p>

<p>Hindus use many symbols and signs. The two most important symbols used by Hindus are named "Aum" and "Swastika".</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, practiced Hinduism is neither <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polytheism.html" title="Polytheism">polytheistic</a> nor strictly <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monotheism.html" title="Monotheism">monotheistic</a>. The various gods and avatars that are worshipped by Hindus are understood as different forms of One truth, sometimes seen as beyond a mere God and as a formless Divine Ground (<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahman.html" title="Brahman">Brahman</a>), akin but not limited to monism, or as one monotheistic principle like <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishnu.html" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> or <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>.</p>
<p>Whether believing in the One source as formless (nirguna brahman, without attributes) or as a personal God (saguna Brahman, with attributes), Hindus understand that the one truth may be seen as different to different people. Hinduism encourages devotees to describe and develop a personal relationship with their chosen deity (ishta devata) in the form of a God or Goddess.</p>
<p>While some censuses hold worshippers of one form or another of <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishnu.html" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> (known as <i>Vaishnavs</i>) to be at 80% and those of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a> (called <i>Shaivaites</i>) and Shakti at the remaining 20%, such figures are perhaps misleading. The vast majority of Hindus worship many gods as varicolored forms of the same prism of Truth. Among the most popular are <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishnu.html" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> (as <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krishna.html" title="Krishna">Krishna</a> or <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rama.html" title="Rama">Rama</a>), <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>, Devi (the Mother as many female deities, such as <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakshmi.html" title="Lakshmi">Lakshmi</a>, Saraswati, <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kali.html" title="Kali">Kali</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durga.html" title="Durga">Durga</a>), <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganesha.html" title="Ganesha">Ganesha</a>, Skanda and <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanuman.html" title="Hanuman">Hanuman</a>.</p>
<p>Worship of the said deities is often done through the aid of pictures or icons (<i>murti</i>) which are said not to be God themselves but conduits for the devotee's consciousness, markers for the human soul that signify the ineffable and illimitable nature of the love and grandeur of <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>. They are symbols of the greater principle, representing and are never presumed to <i>be</i> the concept or entity itself. Thus, Hindu image worship is a form of <a href="../../../i/c/o/Icon.html" title="Icon">iconolatry</a>, in which the symbols are venerated as putative sigils of divinity, as opposed to idolatry, a charge often levied (erroneously) at Hindus. For more details on this form of worship, see murti.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Edit section: Hindu texts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hindu texts</span></h2>
<p>There are many texts relating to Hinduism. Most of them have been written in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. These texts are called Hindu scriptures. Important texts of Hindu religion include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shruti</li>
<li>Smriti</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Shruti" id="Shruti"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Edit section: Shruti">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Shruti</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../v/e/d/Veda.html" title="Veda">Vedas</a> are considered scripture by all Hindus. While the overwhelming majority of Hindus may never read the <a href="../../../v/e/d/Veda.html" title="Veda">Vedas</a>, the reverence for the more abstract notion of eternal knowledge (<i>Veda</i> means knowledge) is etched deep into the hearts of all those who follow Veda Dharma. Classed with the <a href="../../../v/e/d/Veda.html" title="Veda">Vedas</a> (which specifically refer to the Rig/Rg, Yajur, Sama and Atharva Vedas) are their famous commentaries, the <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishad.html" title="Upanishad">Upanishads</a>. While the early Vedas lay the foundation for subsequent Hindu ritual, cosmology and developing philosophy, the <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishads.html" title="Upanishads">Upanishads</a> built the edifice of mystic insight and abhorrence for ritual at the expense of spiritual insight. Forming the core of the Vedanta (<i>End of Vedas</i>), they streamline the excessive litany of praise to Vedic gods and capture the essence of the Rig Vedic dictum "Truth Is One." They set Hindu philosophy apart with its embrace of a single transcendent and yet immanent force that is native to each man's soul, an identification of micro- and macrocosm as One. It can be said that while early Hinduism is most reliant on the four <a href="../../../v/e/d/Veda.html" title="Veda">Vedas</a>, Classical Hinduism, from the <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">Yoga</a> and Vedanta to Tantra and Bhakti streams, was molded around the <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishads.html" title="Upanishads">Upanishads</a>.</p>
