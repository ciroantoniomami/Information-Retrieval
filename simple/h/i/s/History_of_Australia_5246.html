	    <p>People have lived in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> for more than 50,000 years. The first people in Australia were the Aboriginal people. We think they came by <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boat.html" title="Boat">boat</a> from the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island.html" title="Island">islands</a> of what is now <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. They lived in all parts of Australia. Their lives were simple, but they had few needs. They lived by <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunting.html" title="Hunting">hunting</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing.html" title="Fishing">fishing</a> and gathering food. They lived in <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribe.html" title="Tribe">tribes</a>, and they spoke many different <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">languages</a>.</p>
<p>In 1606 the first people from <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> found Australia. They came by sea from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Netherlands_cf8a.html" title="The Netherlands">the Netherlands</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>. First they found the north and west coast. This was dry and apparently uninhabitable land, and they found no economic reasons to stay. But in 1770 an English sailor, Captain <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Cook_83d3.html" title="James Cook">James Cook</a>, encountered the east coast of Australia. He called it New South Wales, and claimed it for Britain. He thought it would be a good place to settle.</p>
<p>In 1788 the British sent a fleet of ships to settle Australia. Britain needed a place to send its convicts (people who had been sent to <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jail.html" title="Jail">jail</a> for <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theft.html" title="Theft">theft</a> and other <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">crimes</a>). Its jails were full. This First Fleet settled at a place they called Sydney. For the first few years they had not much <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food.html" title="Food">food</a>, and life was very hard. But soon they began to <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farm.html" title="Farm">farm</a>, and more people came. Sydney grew, and new towns were started.</p>
<p>Soon people from Sydney found other parts of Australia. George Bass and Matthew Flinders sailed south to Tasmania. Hamilton Hume and William Hovell went south by land. They found the Murray <a href="../../../r/i/v/River.html" title="River">River</a>, and good land in Victoria. Thomas Mitchell went inland, and found more rivers. Others went north and found Queensland. Soon more towns and cities were started. Then, gold was found in 1851. Many more people wanted to come to Australia. The country grew very fast, and some people became very rich.</p>
<p>As the towns and farms spread across Australia, the Aboriginal people were pushed off their land. Some were <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill.html" title="Kill">killed</a>, and many <a href="../../../d/i/e/Die.html" title="Die">died</a> from <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disease.html" title="Disease">illness</a> and hunger. Soon few were left, and they were made to live on small reserves.</p>
<p>In 1840 Britain stopped sending convicts to Australia. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. So in 1855 New South Wales, Victoria and the other colonies established their own Parliaments, where they could make their own laws.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Australia_5246.html" title="Edit section: The Commonwealth of Australia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Commonwealth of Australia</span></h2>
<p>Until 1901, Australia did not exist - it was six separate <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colony.html" title="Colony">colonies</a> governed by Britain. This worked well when everybody was British and there were only a few people. But now there was thousands of people and many of them had never been to Britain, an eight month journey away by sea. If people in one colony wanted to buy or sell things to people in another colony, they had to ask permission.</p>
<p>They decided to join together to form one new country, the Commonwealth of Australia. This was called Federation, and happened in 1901. But Australia was still part of the British Empire, and still felt very close to Britain and the British King. Australia soon had its own money, and its own Army and Navy.</p>
<p>Because Australia was a very big country, and was so close to Asia, the Australians feared that people from Asia might take the country over. So they passed a law that only people from Britain or other "white" countries could come to Australia. This was called the White Australia Policy. It lasted for more than 60 years.</p>
<p>In Australia at this time, the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">trade unions</a> were very strong, and they started a political party, the Labor Party. Australia passed many laws to help the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worker.html" title="Worker">workers</a>. Australia was also one of the first places in the world where women could vote.</p>
<p>In 1914, the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a> started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, against <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>. Australian soldiers were sent to Gallipoli, in Turkey. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on ANZAC Day. They also fought in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>. More than 60,000 Australians were killed in the war.</p>
<p>In 1939 the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a> broke out. Again Australia joined in to help Britain. But in 1941 <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> attacked Australia, and Australians had to fight close to home for the first time. Many people feared that Japan would invade Australia. But with help from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.</p>
<p>When the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people in Europe who had lost their homes in the war. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came from <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> and other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1960s the White Australia Policy was ended. Many people came to Australia from <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and other countries in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>. Australia began to think of itself as an Asian country for the first time. But some Australians did not like this and said that Australia should stay a "white" or European country.</p>
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, because it could <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mining.html" title="Mining">mine</a> a lot of <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a> and other things from the ground that other countries wanted to buy. Companies from <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> came to Australia to increase their <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profit.html" title="Profit">profits</a>, and many Australians got jobs with them. Australia also supported the United States in wars in <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korea.html" title="Korea">Korea</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. Some Australians protested against these wars. Australia's <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> meant that both sides could say what they thought.</p>
<p>Today Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has many problems. Some people are still poor, mainly those who do not have jobs, or whose farms do not make enough money. The Aboriginal people want some of their lands back, and Australians do not agree on what to do about this. Australia also doesn't know what to do with <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refugee.html" title="Refugee">refugees</a> - people who come to Australia by boat saying they have nowhere else to go. Some Australians want to let them stay and live in Australia, but some other Australians do not want to let them in.</p>
