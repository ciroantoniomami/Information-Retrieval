<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Japan_203c.html" title="Edit section: Prehistory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Prehistory</span></h2>
<p>The first period of Japan's history is its <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prehistory.html" title="Prehistory">prehistory</a> period, that is, before the written history of Japan. Archeologists have found <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">pottery</a> of that time. Japan’s Paleolithic era covers a period from around 100,000 BC to around 12,000 BC. This is a very long period of time. Archeologists have found some polished tools made of stones. Some of them are kept in Tokyo's National Museum. These tools are more than 32,000 years old.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Japan_203c.html" title="Edit section: Jomon Period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jomon Period</span></h3>
<p>The Jomon period lasted for about 10,000 years, from 10,000 BC to around 300 BC. This was the Mesolithic era for Japan. Some scholars say that this during this period, Neolithic culture also developed in Japan.</p>
<p>Some scholars believe that the Jomon people were the first people in the world to create pottery. But other scholars do not think so. Archeologists have found several pieces of pottery of that time. Some are clay figures and some are vessels and potteries of different shapes.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Japan_203c.html" title="Edit section: Yayoi Period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Yayoi Period</span></h3>
<p>The Yayoi period covered about 550 years, from around 300 BC till around 250. The period had got its name from a location in Tokyo. By that time, Japanese people had learnt the cultivation of rice. Different clans controlled different areas and they also fought among themselves. Some Chinese texts tell about this time. These texts describe Japan as the Yamatai country. Yamatai came into being when about 30 smaller parts of Japan of that time united under a queen named Himiko.</p>

<p>The Ancient and Classical period covers about 900 years, beginning from the mid-3rd century till the end of the 12th century. The History of Japan of this period may further be divided into several smaller periods. These are described below.</p>
<p><a name="Yamato_period" id="Yamato_period"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Japan_203c.html" title="Edit section: Yamato period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Yamato period</span></h3>
<p>In the history of Japan, the period from the mid-3rd century till around 710 is known as the Yamato period. This period has two parts. The first is the Kofun period (mid-3rd century – mid-6th century). Buddhism had not reached Japan by this time. The second period is called the Asuka period (mid-6th century till around 710). By this time Buddhism had reached Japan.</p>
<p>This period saw many important changes like introduction of the Chinese writing system to Japan. The relationship with Korea and China also brought social changes.</p>
<p><a name="Nara_Period" id="Nara_Period"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Japan_203c.html" title="Edit section: Nara Period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nara Period</span></h3>
<p>During this period, from the year 707, steps were taken to shift the capital to a place near present-day Nara. This was completed in 710. A new city was built. The city was built to look like the Chinese capital city of that time. At that time, the Tang Dynasty was ruling China, and the capital was at Chang'an (now Xi'an).</p>
<p>During the Nara period, development was slow. The Emperor’s family members were always fighting and quarrelling for power with the Buddhists and other groups. At that time, Japan had friendly relations with Korea and China’s Tang Dynasty. The capital was shifted twice. In 784, the capital was moved to Nagaoka and in 794 to <a href="../../../k/y/o/Kyoto.html" title="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>. At that time, Kyoto was known as Heian-kyo.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Japan_203c.html" title="Edit section: Heian Period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Heian Period</span></h3>
<p>The years from 794 to 1185 are known as the Heian Period. The power of the Japanese imperial court (that is, the king, his ministers and other important persons) rose. This period is also famous for its art, poetry and literature. A Japanese style of writing emerged. This style was called Kana. Japanese culture also became different from other parts of Asia.</p>
<p>By the end of this period (that is, by the end of the 12th century), a number of groups came into being. These groups were highly armed and they fought among themselves. The situation was like a civil war, that is, war among different sections of society. Finally, groups of people called <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Samurai">Samurai</a> led society under the political rule of a <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shogun.html" title="Shogun">Shogun</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Japan_203c.html" title="Edit section: Feudal Japan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Feudal Japan</span></h2>
<p>Period from around the 12th century through the 19th century is called feudal period in the history of Japan. The Japanese emperor’s had only a limited power. He was just a nominal head of the government. Many powerful families (called daimyo and military groups (called <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shogun.html" title="Shogun">shogun</a> ruled Japan during this period. The feudal period of Japan is generally sub-divided into different periods named after the shogun, which ruled during that period.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Japan_203c.html" title="Edit section: Kamakura Period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kamakura Period</span></h3>
<p>In the history of Japan, the years 1185 to 1333 are known as the Kamakura Period. The period is named after the government of Kamakura Shogunate. In this period, Mongols tried to invade Japan between the years 1272 and 1281. Japanese were successful at driving away the Mongols. But, this badly affected Japan. Shogunate also became weak and its rule ended in 1333. For a short time, Go Daigo became the emperor of Japan.</p>

<p>Muromachi Period began in 1336 and ended in 1573. Emperor Go-Daigo lost his throne. The government of the Ashikaga shogunate took control of most parts of Japan. This period ended in 1573. In that year the 15th and the last shogun named Ashikaga Yoshiaki was forced to go out of the capital. At that time capital was in Kyōto.</p>
<p>During this period, in 1542, a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> ship reached Japan. Japanese learnt about the guns and firearms from them. In the next few years, merchants from many countries reached Japan. Main countries were <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>.

<p>Azuchi-Momoyama period covers the years from 1568 to 1600. During these years, different parts of Japan became again united. Its military power grew. In 1592, Japan wanted to conquer China. At that time China was ruled by the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ming_Dynasty_71f3.html" title="Ming Dynasty">Ming dynasty</a>. At that time Toyotomi Hideyoshi was one of the main leaders of Japan. He sent an army of 160,000 troops to Korea. But, Japanese could not win and returned back. In 1597, Japan again sent an army to Korea. In 1598 Toyotomi Hideyoshi died. After his death, Japanese dropped the idea to conquer Korea and China.</p>
<p>During this period, Japanese brought many Koreans to Japan. These Koreans were very good at making pottery and at other arts. Some of them were very learned persons. Japan gained new information and knowledge from these Koreans.</p>

<p>During the Edo period, Japan had many small rulers. There number was about two hundred. They were called daimyo. Out of them, the Tokugawa clan was most powerful. They ruled from a place named Edo. This place was around the present day’s Tokyo. For fifteen generations they were the most powerful clan in Japan.</p>
<p>Edo period is also very important period in the history of Japan. Many developments took place. Main developments were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Samurai">Samurais</a> became the highest group in the society. Agriculturists, artisans, and merchants were kept lower than the Samurais.</li>
<li>Common persons were organized in groups of five. If any one of them made any mistake or did anything wrong, all five persons became responsible for that mistake or wrong.</li>
<li>Many new things came out in the field of art. A special type of printing with wood blocks came into being. This is known as the ukiyo-e wood-block printing. Special type of theaters also came into being. They were named the kabuki and bunraku theaters.</li>
<li>Trade and commerce continued to rise during the Edo period.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1868, a war named the Boshin War took place. With this war, the government of the Shogunate ended. Japan again came under the rule of an emperor.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Japan_203c.html" title="Edit section: Seclusion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Seclusion</span></h3>
<p>Beginning from the early <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a>, the rulers of Japan started to follow a policy of seclusion, known as sakoku in Japanese language. They suspected that traders, merchants and missionaries wanted to bring Japan under the control of European powers. These rulers (known as shogunate started a policy of seclusion. Except the Dutch and the Chinese, all foreigners, traders and merchants from other countries, missionaries faced restrictions. They also ordered some foreigners to go out of Japan.</p>
<p>Still even during the period of seclusion, Japanese continued to gain information and knowledge about other parts of the world.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Japan_203c.html" title="Edit section: End of seclusion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">End of seclusion</span></h3>
<p>This policy of seclusion lasted for about 200 years. At last it was ended under force. On July 8th 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">U.S. Navy</a> reached Edo, old <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> with four warships. The ships were heavily armed and their guns pointed towards the city. After shown such a power, Japan was asked to agree to trade with other countries. Later on, Japanese called these ships the <i>kurofune</i>, the Black Ships.</p>
<p>Next year, on 31st March 1854, Perry came with seven ships, and Japanese signed a treaty (known as the Convention of Kanagawa) established diplomatic relationship with the USA. Another treaty (known as the Harris Treaty) was signed with the USA on 29th July 1858. This gave more facilities to foreigners coming to Japan and doing business with Japan. Though Japan started relationship with the USA and several other countries, many Japanese were not happy with this style of forcing Japan to do such things.</p>

<p><a href="../../../m/e/i/Meiji_Restoration_4cc3.html" title="Meiji Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a> is an important period of history of Japan. At that time, Emperor Meiji was ruling Japan. During this period, power of Japan’s emperor (named Meiji) was restored, that is, he gained back his full power. Therefore, the period is called Meiji Restoration. During this period, beginning after the Boshin War of 1868, many changes happened in Japan. The feudal system was ended. Japan copied many systems of the western countries. Changes occurred in Japan’s legal system and the government. By the end of the 19th century, [[Emperor Meiji]’s Japan had become a powerful country.</p>

<p>At the end of the 19th century, a number of learned Japanese supported a particular theory. According to this theory, Japan had to make itself bigger in size to face foreign powers. Thus Japan tried to expand its areas. It wanted parts of nearby countries to make its borders safe. This resulted in wars with its neighboring counties. In 1894-1895, Japan and China had a war. After about ten years, in 1904-1905, another war took place with Russia. Japan became a strong power after these wars. But, Russian influence continued to grow inside China.</p>

<p>By the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, the Russian influence was increasing in China. Japan and the Great Britain used to get economic and other benefits from their relationship with China. Therefore, Japan as well as the Great Britain did not like Russia’s growing influence in China. Both countries discussed the matter. Finally, they signed a treaty on 30th January 1902. They agreed that in the event of any attack or war on any of them, they would fight together. This is known as the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Russia was not happy at this type of agreement. He also tried to sign similar treaty with Germany and France. On 6th March 1902, Russia could sign a similar treaty with France. But, Germany did not join them.</p>
<p>Soon after this, Japan and Russia were at war and fighting with each other. By 1905, Japanese had won several rounds of victories over Tsarist Russia. At that time the Czar ruled Russia, and hence it was called Tsarist Russia. But, the Japanese victory was not final. The USA came to meditate under the US President <a href="../../../t/e/d/Teddy_Roosevelt_286e.html" title="Teddy Roosevelt">Teddy Roosevelt</a>. Japan got a number of concessions. In 1910, Japan completely took over Korea and made that a part of Japan.</p>

<p>In 1914, the First World War broke out. Japan also entered the war. It attacked several places (of East Asia), which were colonies of Germany. After the war ended in 1919, Japan developed very fast. It became one of the major powers of Asia.</p>

<p>Before the beginning of the Second World War, Japan was fighting with China. This is called Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). When the Second World War broke out in 1939, Japan went to the side of Germany and Italy. Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The fighting continued for years. At last, Japan accepted defeat and surrendered in 1945.</p>

<p>Post-Occupation Japan means Japan after its occupation and control by a group of nations had ended. This is the period after the Second World War. The Second World War had damaged Japan very badly. It has almost lost its industry and economy was in a very bad shape. After the war, Japan received assistance and technology from the USA and several other countries of Europe. The progress was very rapid. For about 30 years, from around the 1950s to the 1980s, Japan grew very fast. It became one of the major economic powers of the world.</p>
<p>When the UN forces were fighting in Korea during the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a>, Japan was one of the major suppliers. This also helped Japan’s economy. By 1980s, Japan had become the world’s second largest economy, after the USA. At first, there was very close relationship between Japan and the USA. But, Japan’s economic might resulted into trade deficit for the USA. A trade deficit results when imports are more than exports. Thus, USA was importing more than it exported to Japan.</p>
<p>For various reasons, this phase of rapid development ended in the 1990s. Some historians have described this decade as the lost decade of Japanese economy. About 5 to 10 persons in 100 persons could not find any work. But, the Japanese families and society continued to manage and live well due to their good habit of not wasting money.</p>

<p>By 1952, Japan had become free from most of the controls of occupation period. It got its own democratic system. Various political parties came into being and Japan’s political life became active.</p>

<p>Historians and sociologists call the recent life of Japan as modern life. In Japanese language, this period is called Heisei. By 1989, Japan’s economy had become a very big economy. All round development had taken place. Japan’s military growth again started. In the Gulf war of 1991, Japan gave billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Japan also faced some problems. In 1995, a big earthquake took place in <a href="../../../k/o/b/Kobe.html" title="Kobe">Kobe</a>. Another earthquake took place on 23rd October 2004 in Niigata Prefecture.</p>
