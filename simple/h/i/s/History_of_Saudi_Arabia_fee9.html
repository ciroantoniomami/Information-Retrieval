<p><b>History of Saudi Arabia</b> covers many thousand years with lots of people from different <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">cultures</a> living there. There was a culture called the Dilmun culture among them, which was very old and existed along the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Gulf_06b2.html" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. It was as old as the ancient <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilization.html" title="Civilization">civilizations</a> of <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumer.html" title="Sumer">Sumerians</a> and the <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egyptians</a>. Saudi Arabia had <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade.html" title="Trade">trading</a> relations with many parts of the ancient world. But, the hot and harsh climate had made large <a href="../../../s/e/t/Settlement.html" title="Settlement">settlements</a> difficult. Some big settlements had always existed around oases. these are places in the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert.html" title="Desert">deserts</a> where growth and water are available.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia became an important center, as <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> rose in the 620s. The cities of Medina and <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a> became the holiest places of Islam. They also became the two most holiest cities for the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> of the whole world. The rulers and kings of Saudi Arabia also got more power.</p>

<p>The beginning of the modern history of Saudi Arabia was when an Islamic reformer named Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab and a local ruler named Muhammad bin Saud founded the Saudi <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">statein</a> the year 1744. It was founded in the central part of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabia.html" title="Arabia">Arabia</a>. Over the next Century and a half, the Saud family saw bad and good times. The family also faced opposition from rulers of Egypt and the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. The family also faced opposition from other powerful families of Arabia</p>
<p>Finally after many decades,The modern state of Saudi Arabia could be established by King Abdul Aziz Al-Saud (also known as Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud). In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902.html" title="1902">1902</a>, he took over the city of <a href="../../../r/i/y/Riyadh.html" title="Riyadh">Riyadh</a> from another family, named Al-Rashid. He continued to win more areas, and on <a href="../../../8/_/j/8_January_4e16.html" title="8 January">8 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, he became the King of Hijaz. On <a href="../../../2/9/_/29_January_b729.html" title="29 January">29 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>, he took the title of King of Nejd. On 20th May 1927, the government of the United Kingdom accepted him as the King of the areas ruled by him. His kingdom now became a <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereignty.html" title="Sovereignty">sovereignty</a>. All the regions under his control were united to form the state of Saudi Arabia by the year 1932. Petroleum oil was found in Saudia Arabia on 3 March <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, which made the country rich as <a href="../../../e/x/p/Export.html" title="Export">export</a> of oil started to bring a lot of money.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Saudi_Arabia_fee9.html" title="Edit section: Boundaries">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Boundaries</span></h3>
<p>Saudi Arabia discussed from the beginning of the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> with its neighboring countries about fixing of definite boundaries. It finalized its boundaries with <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, and <a href="../../../k/u/w/Kuwait.html" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>. On borders with Iraq and Kuwait, two <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral.html" title="Neutral">neutral</a> zones were created – one with Iraq, and the other one with Kuwait. In 1934, borders with Yemen were almost finalized.</p>
<p>In 1965, Saudi Arabia gave some of its areas to Jordan, and Jordan gave some of its areas to Saudi Area. In 1971, the neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait was partitioned between these two countries. Likewise, Saudi Arabia and Iraq decided in 1981 to partition the neutral zone between them. The zone was partitioned between the two countries in 1983.</p>
<p>Still, Saudi Arabia's borders with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Arab_Emirates_edab.html" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> and <a href="../../../o/m/a/Oman.html" title="Oman">Oman</a> are not final.

<p>King Abdul Aziz Al-Saud died in 1953. His son named Saud became the king. He reigned for 11 years. In 1964, he was forced to step down, and his half-brother, Faisal, became the king. Faisal had the support of the senior members of the royal family and the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religious</a> leaders. Faisal also held the post of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_2cf9.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a>. This tradition of being both the King and the Prime Minister still continues in Saudi Arabia. All Kings after Faisal had followed this practice.</p>
<p>Faisal took a number of new steps for economic development of Saudi Arabia. During his reign, many important political events also happened like the ones noted below:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Differences between Saudi Arabia and Egypt over Yemen:</i> Egypt supported the new government of Yemen, while Saudi Arabia supported the royal family of Yemen to continue in power.</li>
<li><i>The Six-Day (Arab-Israeli) War of June <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>:</i> Saudi Arabia did not directly fight in this war. But, after the war, it provided financial support to Egypt, <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, and Jordan.</li>
<li><i>Stopping of supply of oil to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">USA</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>:</i> In 1973, many countries stopped supplying petroleum oil to the USA and the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. Saudi Arabia was one of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1975, King Faisal was assassinated by one of his <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nephew.html" title="Nephew">nephews</a>. The nephew was found guilty, and he was sentenced to death. King Faisal's half-brother Khalid became the King and the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. During the reign of King Khalid, Saudi Arabia's importance in regional politics increased. The economic growth of the country also continued at a good rate.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Saudi_Arabia_fee9.html" title="Edit section: King Fahd's period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">King Fahd's period</span></h3>
<p>King Khalid died in 1982. After his death, Fahd became the King. At the same time, he also became the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. His half-brother Prince Abdullah became the Crown Prince.</p>
<p>The income of Saudi Arabia became less during the period of King Fahd's reign. This was a result of lower price of petroleum oil. King Fahd's government used an economic policy which helped the country to survive with a lower income.</p>
<p>King Fahd helped Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war. Iraq's economy had become very bad on account of this war. The King also discussed with these two countries to stop war. Both countries (Iran and Iraq) stopped the war in August 1988,. The King also helped in making Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) a stronger organization. The GCC is an organization of six countries of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Gulf_06b2.html" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. The purpose of the organization is to increase development and cooperation among the member countries.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Saudi_Arabia_fee9.html" title="Edit section: Gulf War">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gulf War</span></h3>
<p>In 1990, Saddam Hussain was ruling Iraq. The <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_bc7b.html" title="Gulf War">Gulf War</a> of 1991 was when he invaded Kuwait. Many people thought that his army would also invade Saudi Arabia. King Fahd allowed some <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western.html" title="Western">Western</a> countries and USA to send their forces to the country. Many Muslims were against that their most holy land was used by non-Muslim <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soldier.html" title="Soldier">soldiers</a>.</p>
<p>During and after the Gulf War, King Fahd’s role was very important. During the war, he allowed the entry of the royal family of Kuwait inside Saudi Arabia and followed by 400,000 other persons from Kuwait to stay on a temporary basis. The King allowed the troops of countries like USA to mount attacks on Kuwait to liberate it. He also helped in arranging support of other Muslim countries for liberation of Kuwait. Iraqi forces were eventually ousted from Kuwait.</p>

<p>Presence of troops from the Western countries has angered many Muslims. One of them was the wealthy man <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>. He was forced to leave Saudi Arabia when he disagreed and opposed the King of Saudi Arabia. Other than Osma bin laden and his groups, there were several other persons and groups who did not like the presence of Western troops inside Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>These persons and their groups attacked people, they tried manly to attack the foreign troops located in Saudi Arabia. Some examples of such attacks are given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>A truck bomb killed 19 troops of the USA in June 1996.</li>
<li>Bombing of a base of Saudi National Guard in November 1995.</li>
</ul>

After enquiry, it came to light that out of 19 suspected persons for these attacks, 15 were from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Such things attracted the attention of the government of Saudi Arabia. The government started a policy to check such activities. Even then, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorist</a> activities of such persons and groups continued.</p>
