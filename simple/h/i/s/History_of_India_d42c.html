<p>Some old <a href="../../../f/o/s/Fossil.html" title="Fossil">fossils</a> found in India indicate presence of living beings called Homo Erectus. <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archeology.html" title="Archeology">Archeologists</a> think that these beings were living in India between 200,000 to 500,000 years ago. This period is known as the paleolithic era. Human beings (Homo Sapiens) settled in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> at least 12,000 years before. At that time the last <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_age.html" title="Ice age">Ice Age</a> had just ended.

<p>About 7000 years before, by 5100 BC, early Neolithic culture had developed in India. People had learnt <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">farming</a>. They tended <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goat.html" title="Goat">goats</a>, lived in houses build of mud, and had learned to make baskets. Potteries were also made.</p>
<p>During the period 6000 BC and 2000 BC, late Neolithic culture and the beginning of the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronze_Age_9719.html" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> was taking shape in the Indus Valley of Ancient India.</p>

<p><a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronze_Age_9719.html" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> was an important period of India’s prehistory. From this time onwards a solid base for more development came.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedas.html" title="Vedas">Vedas</a> are the oldest <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_scripture.html" title="Hindu scripture">texts</a> of India. There are four Vedas, and the first one is the Rigveda. The other three are Samveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda. The Vedas have verses in praise of <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deity.html" title="Deity">gods</a> and others. They also have other information. At that time, the society was pastoral. After the Rigveda, society became more agricultural. People became divided into four classes depending on the type of the work. Brahmins were priests and teachers. Khastriyas were the warriors. Vaishyas did agriculture, trading and commerce. The shudras were the general working class. This type of social division is called the Varna system in Hinduism.</p>
<p>During the period of the Vedic civilization, there were many Aryan clans and tribes. Some of them combined and became bigger like the kingdom of the Kurus.</p>
<p>Islam spread across the Indian subcontinent over a period of 500 years. In the 10th and 11th centuries, Turks and Afghans invaded India and established sultanates in Delhi. In the early 16th century, descendants of Genghis Khan swept across the Khyber Pass and established the Mughal (Mogul) Dynasty, which lasted for 200 years. From the 11th to the 15th centuries, southern India was dominated by Hindu Chola and Vijayanagar Dynasties. During this time, the two systems--the prevailing Hindu and Muslim--mingled, leaving lasting cultural influences on each other</p>

The fighting Huns.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>By the first half of the fifth century, a group of people known as Huns has settled in Afghanistan. They became powerful. They made Bamiyan as their capital city. They started attacking northwestern parts of India. Skandagupta, an emperor of the Gupta dynasty could fight back and kept them away for some years. At last Huns could enter most parts of northern India. With this the Gupta dynasty came to an end. Most of north India became badly affected by this invasion. However, Huns could not go up to the Deccan and the southern parts of India. These parts remained peaceful. No one knows definitely about the fate of Huns after end of the sixth century. Some historians believe that they mixed up fully with the Indian people of that time.</p>

<p>On 15th August 1947, India was partitioned into two countries, India and Pakistan. With this the British Raj in the Indian subcontinent ended. On 26th January, 1950, India adopted a constitution. From that day, India became the Republic of India.</p>
<p>During last 60 years, India has seen different stages in its national life. Some of them are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>It fought four wars against Pakistan, and one war against China. Wars with Pakistan were fought in 1947, 1965, and 1971. The war with China was fought in 1962. In 1971, India also helped <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> in its freedom struggle.</li>
<li>Under the leadership of [[Jawaharlal Nehru) (the first Prime Minister of India), India had adopted a socialist economy. Some economists think it was a mixed economy. In a mixed economy, socialism and capitalism continue together. During this period, lasting for several years up to end-1980s, India could rapidly develop its infrastructure, science and technology.</li>
<li>By early 1990s, India had changed its economic policies. It started several reforms to attract more capital from other countries. Local businessmen and industrialist also got more freedom to carry out their activities.</li>
<li>In 1974, India had already detonated its first nuclear bomb. It repeated the same in 1998. With this, it became a nuclear power.</li>
</ul>
<p>Presently (2006), India is currently the tenth largest economy in terms of gross <a href="../../../g/r/o/Gross_Domestic_Product_fa2b.html" title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</a>. It is the 4th largest economy of the world when accounting for purchasing power parity. Some economists think that in coming decades, India’s economy shall become still larger.</p>
