== I appreciate the work you've been doing, but can I make a couple suggestions? You seem to add a lot of new articles, but they tend to be very short, don't use <a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia%7ESimple_English_dd09.html" title="Wikipedia:Simple English">Simple English</a>, and sometimes have a lot of spelling errors. This may make a lot of work for other editors later, and there aren't very many of us here. Have a read about <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_write_Simple_English_articles_4d1c.html" title="Wikipedia:How to write Simple English articles">how to write Simple English articles</a> and don't feel obligated to fill in gaps by creating a lot of new articles. It will happen over time. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 21:08, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

To be more direct - <b>do not copy articles</b> directly from the regular English Wikipedia. It is a violation of our licensing and it creates more work for other editors and admins.

Hi Hailey C. Shannon, I appliciate your industrious work, but wouldn't you like to improve your edits? In my opinion <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_stub_article_271a.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect stub article">Wikipedia:The perfect stub article</a> has many good suggestions toward you. Specially it is better to write two or three sentences rather than only one article. And you will be appliciated to add a stub tag, like {{stub}}. It helps us to find articles which we need expand. Cheers. --<a href="../../../a/p/h/User%7EAphaia_616a.html" title="User:Aphaia">Aphaia</a> 17:21, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey, Hailey. I'd like to thank you for the edits you made to "Ned Declassified School Survival Guide." You changed the article for the better. By the way, do you really watch that show?

<p>Hi Hailey C. Shannon, do you consider to add a {{stub}} sag if you create a very short article? In my humble opinion, an article with few sentences nedd to be expanded and a stub tag is very useful to find them. Moreover you create many short article with only one sentence. But in my humble opinion it is not user-friendly. Could you try to put at least two or three sentences when you create an article? Cheers. --<a href="../../../a/p/h/User%7EAphaia_616a.html" title="User:Aphaia">Aphaia</a> 19:45, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Just a question. What is the point of these birth and death categories that you keep inserting. Surely if somebody wanted to know the year, they would just go to the year page and look under eith births or deaths? It seems like duplicate information and a waste of space to me, but am open to hearing the argument.

<p>Hailey, is there a reason you are creating these empty year pages? Since you aren't even putting them into <a href="../../../y/e/a/Category%7EYears_0e74.html" title="Category:Years">Category:Years</a>, all these are doing are creating more work for me when I get to sorting those into decades and centuries. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 3 July 2005 22:29 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I apologize if I was a bit harsh earlier Hailey, but all I'm asking is that, if you are getting to these pages from somewhere, based on something, can you add that to the article? The birth, the death, the event, whatever. Otherwise, one can make hundreds of year articles with absolutely nothing in them and that simply is more work for others to organize. Once a number of years are into decades and centuries, I will feel much better about empty articles since somebody else can place them in the right spots if they'd like once the setup is there. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 5 July 2005 08:06 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hailey, a number of points. I believe I've asked you numerous times to add the proper categories for things. If you are creating new year pages, please add them to <a href="../../../y/e/a/Category%7EYears_0e74.html" title="Category:Years">Category:Years</a> if you are not going to add them to the proper category, decade, etc. I do not wish to have to go back through and try to figure out which ones you've created. Also, why are you adding so many things for the decade categories (like the <a href="../../../1/9/6/Category%7E1960s.html" title="Category:1960s">60s</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/Category%7E1970s.html" title="Category:1970s">70s</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/Category%7E1980s.html" title="Category:1980s">80s</a> etc)? You can see the categories are for the years, etc. I guess I can create a category structure for the movies, tv shows, etc that you are putting there. Another question: why did you change the link at <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Ogden_Steirs_462a.html" title="David Ogden Steirs">David Ogden Steirs</a>? There is no article at that page (it's not spelled correctly for one reason) which will make it <b>more</b> difficult to correct later one. If you are going to add to articles like at <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_31.html" title="October 31">October 31</a>, you need to at least try to simplify them. Leaving text like "In an effort to try restore investor confidence, the New York Stock Exchange unveils a fifteen-point program aimed to upgrade protection for the investing public" just creates more work for other people. It also looks like you still haven't correctly the errors I pointed out to a few weeks back. Last, can you please use edit summaries? I think enough people have asked at this point and it makes it much easier to follow you. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 01:44, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I gave this advice before, but I'm afraid I must insist now. While noone expects you to be a perfect editor, we do expect that you won't create <i>more</i> work for use. Go more slowly, and carefully, and you should be fine. The things that I and now Ricky81682 are asking for are very simple requests which you should abide by almost all the time, if you are careful. If you don't know a piece of information, look up the same article on the <a href="../../../../en/index.html" class="extiw" title="en:">en: Wikipedia</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 05:39, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Because Ricky and I are serious, I need to tell you that your recent few contributions show absolutely no change. I am blocking you for the weekend (48 hours). If you want to intentionally create stubs <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lumberjack&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49294" class="external text" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lumberjack&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49294" rel="nofollow">this</a> is exactly <i>not</i> what we need. You left no edit summary, no category, no interwiki links, no wiki links at all. That article is useless and is barely better than a blank page. Unfortunately, now that it's there, someone may not see that it needs a lot of work.</p>
<p>When you come back, I want to see immediate improvement. The easiest thing to do is to find the main Wikipedia article (<a href="../../../../en/l/u/m/Lumberjack.html" class="extiw" title="en:Lumberjack">en:Lumberjack</a>) and simplify the words.</p>
<p>If you agree to do better, and contact me by email or your talk page here, I will lift the block. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 06:23, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

If you aren't going to format them (and that's fine with me), don't make me have to go wander around trying to find them. I don't think that's an unreasonable request. I do want to thank you for your help fighting vandals. If somebody goes on a streak of vandalism, you can just put a note on their talk page. That usually stops them for a least a little while. Since the rules require at least a warning before I can block people, if they continue I can put a stop to things completely. A good thing would be to simply put {{subst:test}} and sign it (I would like to have a date/time reference to see). It simply pastes the <a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test template</a> on their talk page. The "subst" page makes it a stamp instead of a link (it's doesn't really make that much of a difference in the end). -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>)</dd>

<p>Hailey, why are you warning this user? He hasn't done anything wrong. You need to be a little more careful with your warnings.

<p>Hi! I was up late and thought I'd stop by; haven't been here for a long time.</p>
<p>You might want to add something on that film's star, Charles "Buddy" Rogers. Mr. Rogers was not only an actor but a jazz trombonist and a huge benefactor and philanthropist out where I live. He helped found a unique all-volunteer symphony orchestra in which I was principal trumpet for a bit, that is, until I got sick of the politics and quit the group. Anyway, the orchestra was doing a gig he happened to be at...and he just happened to have his trombone with him. He got it out at the intermission and I joined in a little jazz improv with him and a couple of other jazz players. I will never forget that! - Lucky 6.9 08:14, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
