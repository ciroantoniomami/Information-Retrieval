<p>Hamilton is on the west end of the Niagara Peninsula. To the north of Hamilton are the waters of <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Ontario_d812.html" title="Lake Ontario">Lake Ontario</a> and Burlington Bay, also called Hamilton Harbour. In the middle of Hamilton is the Niagara Escarpment, also called Hamilton Mountain because it is 198 meters high. Many small rivers or creek flow over the Mountain and into the Bay or Lake.</p>
<p>There are three different ways to count the number of people in Hamilton. The old city of Hamilton, before it was created from six other cities and towns, has 331,000 people living in it. The new city of Hamilton, after it joined with other towns, has 502,000 people. The Greater Hamilton area, including Burlington and Grimsby, has 684,000 people.</p>
<p>The people of Hamilton are from many different countries and speak many different languages. They belong to many different <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">races</a> and religions, too. Among its people are: Italian, Irish, Mohawk Natives, British , Vietnamese, Caribbean blacks, Portuguese, Czechs and Slovaks, Hungarians, Poles, Romanians, Serbians, Ukrainians and Dutch.</p>

<p>For over 150 years, Hamilton has had factories. For over 100 years, most of them have been steel factories like Stelco and Dofasco. Since the strike of 1946, the workers at Stelco have had a trade union. The workers at Dofasco do not have a trade union. There was also a Studebaker <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cars.html" title="Cars">car</a> factory in Hamilton until 1966.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, industries in Hamilton have had trouble making money and keeping people working. In 2004, Stelco filed for bankruptcy. This means Stelco asked the courts if it could stop paying money it borrowed back to banks. The future for industry does not look good for Hamiltonians.</p>
<p>However, other businesses look much better. You might not think of schools like McMaster University and Mohawk College as businesses, but they are. Students and teachers come to Hamilton and spend there money here. Doctors, teachers, nurses and other professionals train here. Even Tim Hortons doughnut stores started in Hamilton in 1965.</p>

<p>CH has been a local TV station in Hamilton since 1954. Steve Smith, known for starring in <i>The Red Green Show</i>, started working at CH. <i>Tiny Talent Time</i> is another popular show on CHCH which features many children.</p>
<p>Some movies were filmed in and around Hamilton, such as <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> and <i>Rocky V</i>, because it looks like other places.</p>
<p>Folksinger Stan Rogers was born in Dundas, which became part of Hamilton in 2001. The Appleton sisters, now famous in Britain, were born in Hamilton. Daniel Lanois is an important singer himself and helped the band U2 with its music. He lived in Hamilton and recorded at Grant Avenue Studios.</p>
<p><i>The Hamilton Spectator</i> newspaper has been around since the 1840s. It offers tours showing its giant printing press and writers' offices. It also has school projects which include a classroom subscription to the newspaper for every student.</p>

<p><a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">Government</a> is how people organize themselves to be directed by <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a>. Hamilton was part of Wentworth County until 1974. Wentworth County included the townships of: Ancaster, Barton, Beverly, Binbrook, East Flamborough, West Flamborough, Glanford and Saltfleet. Here is how the government of Hamilton changed over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>About 1814 the area became capital of Wentworth County</li>
<li>1815 George Hamilton laid out a townsite in Barton Township and named it after himself</li>
<li>1816 Hamilton became capital of Gore District</li>
<li>1833 Hamilton became a police village</li>
<li>1833 Hamilton became a city</li>
<li>1974 Hamilton remained a city and became part of Hamilton-Wentworth Region which also had five other communities: Ancaster, Dundas, Flamborough, Glanbrook and Stoney Creek (how many of these look the same as the original townships of Wentworth County?)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2001 Hamilton-Wentworth Region and all six of its communities became one city called Hamilton</li>

<p><a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">Politics</a> is the way people choose the leaders of their communities and the things they decide are important enough to do. Hamiltonians like choosing socially minded people to governm themselves, especially women and minorities. Many people who were mayors, members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) or members of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">Parliament</a> (MPs) have things named for them in the city, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sam Lawrence was mayor in the 1940s. Lawrence Park on the Mountain is named after him.</li>
<li>Ellen Fairclough became Canada's first female cabinet minister in 1957. A government office building is named after her.</li>
<li>Lloyd D. Jackson was mayor in the 1960s. Jackson Square in downtown Hamilton is named after him.</li>
<li>John Munro was an MP and cabinet minister under Prime Minister <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Trudeau_6783.html" title="Pierre Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a> in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

<li>Lincoln ‘Linc’ Alexander was Canada's first black MP in 1965, first black cabinet minister in 1979 and first black lieutenant governor in 1985. A public school and the expressway are named after him.</li>

<p>Netural and Mohawk Native Canadians of the Six Nations were the first people to live in this area. In <a href="../../../1/6/1/1616.html" title="1616">1616</a>, Étienne Brûlé probably became the first European to visit what is now Hamilton. United Empire Loyalists moved into the Hamilton area during and after the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a>. The Battle of Stoney Creek was fought during the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_1812.html" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a> in what is now Hamilton.</p>
<p>In the mid- to late <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">1800s</a>, Hamilton became an industrial city with lots of <a href="http://collections.ic.gc.ca/industrial/" class="external text" title="http://collections.ic.gc.ca/industrial/" rel="nofollow">factories</a>. It was close to limestone from the Niagara Escarpment, coal from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, iron ore mined from northern Ontario. But factories demanded that people work hard jobs for long hours. In 1872, Hamilton workers marched for a work day of no more than nine hours! The two large steel factories were Stelco (the Steel Company of Canada), created in 1910 and the Dofasco (Dominion Steel Casting Company) in 1912. Dominion is an old word often heard to describe Canada when it was part of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>.</p>
<p>Many schools were built between <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>, including Adelaide Hoodless School, Memorial School (for the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>, Viscount Allenby School (WWI general) and Earl Kitchener School (WWI general). The First World War is often shortened to WWI.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> hit Hamilton. People were unemployed and poor. Factories stoped running. Times were hard. Then the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> started and people got jobs again in the army and building guns for the army. August 19, 1942, hundreds of young men from Hamilton were killed by the German army when they tried to attack Dieppe in France.</p>

<p>The city streets in the old city of Hamilton follow a pattern. The big streets going north and south are in straight lines. When they are on the Mountain, they have "Upper" in front the their names, except for Garth Street which should be Upper Dundurn Street.</p>
<p>Streets are called "North," such as "James Street North," if they are north of King Street or Queenston Road. Streets are called "South" if they are south of King or Queenston. Streets are called "East," such as "East 5th Street" or "Main Street East," if they are east of James Street or Upper James Street. Streets are called "West" if they are west of James or Upper James.</p>
<p>King and Main Streets are major roads that are almost <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel.html" title="Parallel">parallel</a> or side by side one another. They cross at the Delta in east Hamilton. For most of King and Main, cars could only travel one way. So instead of thinking of them as two streets, think of them as one street with a very wide boulevard between them. This changed in the early 2000s, and most of the streets in Downtown Hamilton are now two-way.</p>
<p>Throughout the city there are some neighbourhoods with weird or strange street names. For example, Birdland has streets named after birds like Cardinal, Blue Jay and Swallow. Another neighbourhood on the Mountain has streets named after people from the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, such as Napoleon, Josephine, and Robespierre. Riverdale West, in the Lower City, has streets named after types of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berry.html" title="Berry">berries</a>.</p>
