<p><b>"I also have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat".</b> I know wingeing is probably a bad idea but "blood, toil, tears and sweat" is a terrible example. That is an idiom (that I remember as "blood, sweat and tears" but anyway...) which is good to use only if it is the subject ie it appears in Blood Sweat and Tears. If it must appear then explain its sense not its literal meaning: 'He said he gave "blood, toil, tears and sweat" (He worked very hard.)' (But better than that)</p>
<p>I would much prefer some guidance on how to simplify <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insect.html" title="Insect">scientific</a> or culture specific entries.</p>
<p>Also I question the idea that the simple encyclopedia would be primarily for non English speakers, don't they have there own language versions? If the simple version is to exist it should be for English speaking children or people with learning diabilities. &lt;/rant&gt;</p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, please, but I always understood that quote to mean he was offering the British _their own_ "blood, toil, tears and sweat", not (only) his; a warning of difficult times to come, and a call to face them squarely. 207.197.128.52 18:15, 10 July 2006 (UTC).</p>
<p>I agree, so an alternative phrase might be: "All I can promise you is hard work, sadness and pain"212.98.32.30 09:26, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd welcome peer review of my first SE article at <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Keynes_e083.html" title="Milton Keynes">Milton Keynes</a>. --Concrete Cowboy 16:16, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would suggest using natural language rather than Basic English and monitoring whether you are staying within your word limits with a tool like Vocabprofile: <a href="http://www.lextutor.ca/vp/" class="external free" title="http://www.lextutor.ca/vp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lextutor.ca/vp/</a></p>
<p>Extensive reading of graded readers with limited vocabulary is an effective method of language learning advocated by experts such as Richard Day at the University of Hawaii and Nation at Victoria University Wellington</p>

<dd>Web VP (<a href="http://www.lextutor.ca/vp/" class="external text" title="http://www.lextutor.ca/vp/" rel="nofollow">Vocabulary Profiler</a>) is a well done program to look for common words, but may I give an experience. I learned the most common Dutch words before going to Holland and was able to get the filler parts of every sentence, but not the meaning of any sentence because the useful words with substance were not there. Does WebVP have an option to use our vocabulary (Basic English) so that the non-Simple English words are highlighted&#160;? Answer -- <b>Yes&#160;!!!</b></dd>

The documentation is complete -- 15 page in word.doc . The word lists are simple text files. Therefore, it seems able to add the Basic 850 words in the same format to <i>basewrd1.txt</i> and the Basic 1500 words and/or Special English 1500 to <i>basewrd2.txt</i>. The program will then give color coded results for pure Simple English in blue&#160;; for advanced Simple English as green&#160;; and for non-Simple words as red.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia_talk%7EHow_to_write_Simple_English_articles_54e0.html" title="Edit section: Changes by Netoholic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Changes by Netoholic</span></h2>
<p>I was not at all surprised when you (Netoholic) changed this page as soon as I mentioned it on <a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ESimple_English_Wikipedia_1fb2.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Simple English Wikipedia">Wikipedia talk:Simple English Wikipedia</a>, but that does not mean I am against the two main changes you made. I like very much the fact that you chose relatively neutral terminology when you changed my edit, particularly in the second place, where it now says "link to a page which gives more detail on the word." I hope you don't mind if I add slightly to that, since it is rather vague where they link to. I'll say ", such as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a>. That page mentions/links to both wiktionaries (my change, I'll admit), and therefore won't bother anyone, I hope.</p>
<p>The first place you made a change, however, I don't like so much, because it says "If no other word is good, add your word." I think this doesn't work, because even though it sounds like neutral terminology ("you can add it wherever you see fit"), the implicit assumption is that they will add it to Simple English Wikipedia, rather than Simple English Wiktionary. But I won't change it until we all make a collective decision on <a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ESimple_English_Wikipedia_1fb2.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Simple English Wikipedia">Wikipedia talk:Simple English Wikipedia</a>, and even then only if that decision is in favor of my position. Edit wars and actions without consensus are counterproductive, which is why I haven't gone all over SEWikipedia, moving definitions to SEWikt and linking words where they appear to SEWikt. I am very ready and willing to do so, but I will not until there is consensus to do so. I suppose the main reason I think that linking to English Wiktionary doesn't make sense in any of the ideas I have regarding SEWikipedia is because in my ideas, the words would not have their own page here, and therefore it would be very clumsy to link to both whenever a word appeared. Since I feel that SEWiktionary is the preferable choice, that is what I would link to, with a link on the corresponding SEWiktionary page to English Wiktionary for those who want more. However, if at the end of everything consensus decides that we should keep short descriptions here, both wiktionaries should be then linked.</p>
<p>BTW, one of the things I like about disagreeing with you (yes, there are some, even though I don't like disagreeing!) is that even though we (or at least I) have gotten a little ruffled, we have succeeded in keeping personal attacks and heated words out of our conversations and discussions. Whether I agree with you or not, your words have been civil, and I thank you for that. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 22:14, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why did you revert my edit? And why did you revert it without explanation? And why did you revert it as a minor edit? I can understand doing so when it is vandalism or patent nonsense or something of the sort, but my edit was made in good faith and improves the page by specifying a possible location to link to, rather than leaving that up to the reader's imagination. Perhaps it would have been better for me to not mention that I changed the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a> page to include both English Wiktionary and Simple English Wiktionary, so that you wouldn't know the difference and wouldn't object? I don't think so either. In fact, I specifically mentioned the fact that I changed the other page, because I knew it was something you might disagree with. But I expected you to talk about it, not to revert without comment. My mentioning the change I had made is in keeping with my policy of making sure that all my edits which someone might disagree with are <i>not</i> marked as minor, to give others a chance to disagree, etc. I am trying my best to be absolutely fair to all parties, to explain my edits, and not hide any of them, etc., even when to do so exposes them to possible reverts, etc. by people who disagree with me. Why don't you do the same? I think you called it a minor edit because it was not something large (I am again assuming good faith), but that makes it appear as if you are attempting to hide the edit from people who might disagree with you, like I might. I agree that marking small edits as minor and not clogging the Newest Changes page with tons of tiny changes is generally good policy, but to avoid appearing like you are pushing an agenda or hiding your edits that others might possibly disagree with, I recommend never marking those particular edits as minor, and always giving them explanations (not just a revert summary), especially if you could explain them on the talk page. Of course, you are free to do what you think is right, but these steps would help keep others (such as myself) from being tempted to feel that the edits/reverts are made in bad faith. Once again, I will not revert your revert, because edit wars are counterproductive and I want to reach a consensus on this, but that doesn't mean I agree with you on this point (although I don't know exactly what you think about it, due to your lack of explanation). As always, let me know what you think, and comments from others are certainly welcome, too. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 23:38, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I think the section you removed had some valuable extra information, but I'll let it go. However, the rest of my comments, including the value of telling them other places they can link to, such as Wiktionary, still stand. That one would especially apply when the article linked to is only a description/definition. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 23:46, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Per the discussion at <a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia%7ESimple_talk_51fd.html#Project_direction" title="Wikipedia:Simple talk">Wikipedia:Simple talk#Project direction</a>, in which it was agreed that we should link to the Simple English Wiktionary, I am going to add another point (2.5) to the method section, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not all words are encyclopedic. If you want to link to the dictionary definition of a word rather than an encyclopedic article, link to the <a href="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikt:Main_Page">Simple English Wiktionary</a> using [[:wikt:this]] (put your word in place of "this") to link to <a href="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/this" class="extiw" title="wikt:this">this</a>. For a more complex definition, you may also link to the <a href="../../../../en/m/a/i/wikt%7EMain_Page_5568.html" class="extiw" title="en:wikt:Main_Page">English Wiktionary</a> like this: [[:en:wikt:this]].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am also adding the guideline template, but this should not be construed as an attempt to legitimize my edit. If it is a bad edit, talk to me about it here or on my <a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk page</a>, and let's get it right. Thanks. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 00:50, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looking at it on the page, perhaps it would be better to leave out the markup for linking. They can look that up under the appropriate help article.

<p>I just looked at the page <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandenburg.html" title="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a> and to my ears it really sounds bad. The grammar sounds as if it was translated directly from german to english. I would like to change those pages but since I'm really new to "simple english" I could make a mistake by doing so. In fact I just followed the link to the "simple english" version from the german version of this article and then looked at some other pages and realized that there was something like "simple english" - I haven't heard of it before. (BTW: Do we have to use "simple english" on the discussion pages as well?) <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.197.85.180.html" title="User:217.197.85.180">217.197.85.180</a> 06:39, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Full English "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat" in Basic English is "blood, hard work, drops from eyes, and body water".</p>
<p>What makes body water equate to sweat and not tears, urine or blood?</p>
<hr />
<p>It is not funny; just bad translation. The goal of translation is to relate the author's sense. In Simple English&#160;: Blood is blood or danger. Toil is work. Tears indicate trouble or pain. Sweat makes the point of very hard work, or in this case, more work. "Blood, work, pain and more, very hard, work." This might be made more poetic, but it is a direct translation.</p>
