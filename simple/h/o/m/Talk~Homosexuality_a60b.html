<p>Thanks for the edit. I can't <i>believe</i> I mis-spelled lesbian.&#160;;)</p>
<p>Though I chose know rather than believe with intent because that better reflects the level of scientific understanding. Its like the 'theory' versus 'fact' debate between scientists and creationists. Scientists refer to the 'theory of evolution' and creationists seize that and claim evolution is 'only a theory' (using the vernacular meaning of the word theory meaning 'imperfect fact.') This is what Stephen Jay Gould meant when he defined evolution both as a scientific theory and a scientific fact. That is, evolution is a scientific theory, but it is also a scientific fact: “In science, 'fact' can only mean 'confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.'“</p>
<p>That homosexuality is determined by biology is known with that degree of certainty. So I chose the word 'know' rather than believe to distinguish by connotation. So, evolution through random mutation with natural selection is a scientific fact. And homosexuality as an innate biologically determined characteristic is a scientific fact. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">Nick</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Your choice of parallel is perfect, in my view. And while I agree with the conclusion that the range of human behavior here is very likely to be biologically determined, perhaps it is still too 'soon' to say the weight of evidence is sufficient for proof? That is, has "that degree" really been reached? (Sorry - I hate that kind of argument.) <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 05:21, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The evidence that homosexuality is effected by genetics is well past sufficient. The question of whether it is a choice is also well past sufficient since no decent study of reparative therapy published in the peer-reviewed literature that shows it works (despite a lot of people trying.) Now certainly, homosexual <i>behavior</i> can be changed, but orientation isn't – which generally means that unless significant social pressures exist, any changes in behavior are temporary. (Ex: FoF's John Paulk, Falwell's Michael Johnston.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Basically it is at the same level as Evolution and Creationism/Intelligent Design. That is, sexual orientation as a biological trait that is essentially immutable is accepted by the vast majority of legitimate scientists and clinicians. Many of the major medical associations (Royal College of Psychiatrists, both APAs, the American Academy of Peds, the AMA, etc) have gone to the trouble of making public statements that reparative therapy is unsupported, unhealthy, voodoo. There is a ton of literature published in peer-reviewed journals that support this conclusion through multiple logical pathways (studies of twins, animal studies, genetics, pathology, trials.) However there is a very vocal and motivated minority that makes its conclusions based on religious dogma and then tries to cloak it in the trappings of science. For example, NARTH's oft quoted study of 'ex-Gays' with a 70-something% success rate, that was 'done by researchers at Brigham Young University' (but which... oddly enough has never been published in a peer reviewed journal.... hmmm. I wonder why?) Or even better the 'American College of Pediatricians' which is a bunch of fundies who established it in 2002 when the AAP (which they are obviously trying to imitate) came out with a policy statement supporting co-parent adoptions.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The evidence is not as robust as the evidence today is for evolution, however, evolution reached that level of 'truth' many years ago. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">Nick</a></dd>

<p>Great text... just one quick note: the last section (military and legal recognition) would be much more interesting if it included some references about the USA and other countries.</p>
<p>For example I find it strange that no reference is made to the fact that people of the same sex can get married in Holland... or that you don't mention the famous "don't ask, don't tell" policy of the USA Army.</p>

<p>No, modern science does <i>not</i> believe it is <i>either</i> a choice or malleable. There may be some crackpots who believe differently like those bigots at NARTH. However, that is not the prevailing viewpoint of science and medicine. The AMA, all three APAs, AAP, AAFP, and other groups have made official position statements regarding the innate and immutable nature of sexual orientation (as well as declaring reparative therapy as provided by the NARTH crackpots as not only ineffectual, but in fact, <i>harmful.</i>) The more we research it, the more there is evidence that it is due to a complex interaction of genetics (about half of all identical twins are concordant for same sex attraction,) early hormonal influences, as well as other possible biological effects.</p>
<p>Stating that the prevailing scientific belief is that it <i>may not be</i> a choice is like saying that descent with modification and diversification through natural selection and mutation <i>might be but not necessarily is</i> the way science believes that modern forms of organisms came to exist.</p>
<p>Just because <i>your</i> POV is that it is a choice, that does not change the factual statement that mainstream modern science understands that it is no more of a choice than is left-handedness. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 15:05, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I agree with your point about modern science Nick, there are also certain situations where people act in a homosexual (or heterosexual) way when they wouldn't otherwise. Consider men in a prison situation or the pederasty (the relationship between a young and an older man) among the ancient Greeks. Would you consider them gay based upon their actions or would you say that they are not based upon their beliefs? They may act in a homosexual matter and would have heterosexual relationships outside of that but would never consider themselves bisexual. I would say that another part of homosexuality is based on actions, not only on relationships which isn't really discussed here. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 23:47, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Basically, there are two competing definitions of homosexuality. The definition accepted by most human rights groups, the medical/psychological profession, and LGBT people themselves is that it is about ones orientation. That is, what one feels inside. Homosexuality is defined by who one is attracted to.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The definition that you are proposing is the one used by the religious right. (Not that I think you are a member of the religious right, but it gets cultural play, so I can see how you would see that.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While I think it would be fine to say that there are people who are religious conservatives who believe that homosexuality is a behavior (like NARTH and others who do reparative therapy), I think it is important to put this in context. That context is that reparative therapy, and the underlying principle that homosexuality (or heterosexuality) is defined not by who one is, but how one behaves, is condemned by the medical profession and almost every human rights organization. For example, the American Academy of Pediatrics, all three APAs, the AMA, etc have all condemned reparative therapy and its premises as not only useless but psychologically harmful.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But the best way I can ask this question is this: (I am assuming you are straight) If I put a gun to your head and made you have sex with a man, would that make you gay? If not, then its the way you feel inside – your emotional and sexual preference – that determines your orientation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course this brings up the whole self-definition issue too. -<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 01:23, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, if there are two different issues, then we need to mention them both. <a href="../../../../en/h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" class="extiw" title="en:Homosexuality">English</a> refers to three meanings: (1) The sexual orientation aspect of caring for somebody with the same sex as discussed throughly here (2) The act itself and (3) how being considered gay affects a person's identity. We only discuss one. If there is a disagreement about the meaning of the term, that is what the article should focus on. Frankly, I'm a little annoyed that you seem to feel that anything by the religious right should be dismissed out of hand completely (I'm no fan of them by any stretch) but it is still worth mentioning. State their position and contrast that with the opposition. The article isn't supposed to give an opinion. The information about issues gays face (both personal and societal and both in more length), organizations (more specific and even some history), etc could be cut in specific here and put in detail in separate articles. Also, the only context of behavior is not reparative therapy. I think that's pretty clear here. Frankly, perhaps that argument should be separated into a separate article where it can be more clearly defined. We don't need to have everything in a single article, you know? That way, the discussions regarding each section aren't stuffed into a single mess. Would you agree to that? -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 02:56, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So pretty much by any definition of torture or medical torture, I believe forcing the man to take foreign hormones to suppress his libido that placed him at risk of death (DVT/PE) and subsequently caused him to enter such a depression that he committed suicide rather than continue his life in such a way qualifies as torture. -<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 01:04, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Look, I'm not going to play a game with you regarding the strictest definition of terms. When you say that he was tortured, people have a certain interpretation of that word. Ok, he was psychologically tortured due to his decision to take the hormones rather than go to jail, a decision he shouldn't have been forced to make. Still, that's not what people think of when you say he was tortured. Frankly, I think you could even remove the "Without Turing, the Allies might not have won WWII" sentence. State the facts of what happened to Turing and leave it at that. I think it is pretty clear to the reader that what was done to Turing was not good. I do not like the idea of inserting a view into the article. That goes against the whole point of NPOV. Frankly, why is there this much detail regarding Turing in this article? It is supposed to be about homosexuality in general. I think noting that it used to (and continues to be in some places) considered a crime is sufficient. Also, you do not need to move article information over.

<dd>Mostly because he's a really good example (and to be honest, because there is an article about him already on simple.) I also put in the example of the two teenaged boys who were recently executed in Iran.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With regard to whether or not its NPOV, what is not N about it? Like specifically? I am seriously asking. This isn't just a stupid 'well its all just facts' logical fallacy I am positing... but seriously, what is the objectionable POV and what would be a better neutral statement of same.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry to be a bit nit-picking like this. But this seems to me a bit like making a claim that someone did not have an NPOV when writing about the Tuskeegee Syphillis Study if they didn't talk about the medical 'knowledge' gained from the TSS. I mean, it was wrong by any modern definition, so why is bad to have to say so?-<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 02:54, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I understand perfectly. I think the level of detail regarding Turing should be the same as regarding Wilde. Something like "Alan Turing, the man helped the Allies in WWII by breaking the Enigma code used by the Germans, was convicted of this crime and ultimately killed himself over the effects" and leave the details at the Turing article itself. It's not that I don't want the Turing information there (it shows the point incredibly well). It points out how quite clearly that a number of great people have been effected by this closed-minded thinking. It's just that I don't want the article to try to be an all-inclusive long-winded article. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 03:04, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>“fear of what would happen” + “or because they do not live in a safe place.” That is more subtle. If you live in Canada, its probably fear. If you live in Iran, you may be brave but not stupid (because you do not live in a safe place.)</p>

<p>The entire point of that comment was to indicate that while the UK has changed many things, LGBT people still do not have full equal rights and many things will need to be changed to make that equality complete. That is, while the UK has done much, they have not yet granted full equality under the law to their LGBT citizens. However, in the interests of keeping it simple and short, I used that phrase. A longer, less simple, version is now in the article.</p>
<p>And why is it POV that a country that does not grant full basic human rights (as in natural rights, not legal or civil rights) to its citizens has a way to go? Or is it your POV that some groups do not deserve basic human rights (as detailed in the universal declaration of human rights)? That is, for example, would you also have that complaint that the article isn't NPOV if <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_versus_board_of_education.html" title="Brown versus board of education">Brown versus board of education</a> didn't explain how the white parents in Topeka, KS were made uncomfortable by African American children in their grade schools? Would it be bad to say in an article on the civil rights of women in Iran that while there has been progress made there is a ways to go.</p>
<p>Or is this a double standard. Universal human rights are universal... except for some groups? In some groups its ok to stop half-way?</p>
<p>But if it is the case that one accepts human rights are a standard, why is it POV to state that the UK has a ways to go before they extent full human rights to all citizens (since they do not at present)?-<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 03:48, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually there are less words and less unsimple words in far to go (zero actually.) That is also an understandable idiom in context. (Being 'far off' or 'far away' or 'distant' have similar implications cross culturally.)
