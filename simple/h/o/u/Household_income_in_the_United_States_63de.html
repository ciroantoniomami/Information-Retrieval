<p>The <b>Household income in the United States</b> is a measure of current private income commonly used by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> government and private institutions. To measure the income of a household, the pre-tax money receipts of all residents over the age of 15 are combined. Most of these receipts are in the form of wages and salaries (before withholding and other taxes), but many other forms of income, such as unemployment insurance, disability, child support, etc., are included as well. The residents of the household do not have to be related to the householder for their earnings to be considered part of the household's income.<sup id="_ref-Definition_of_household_income_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Definition_of_household_income" title="">[1]</a></sup> While the use of household income remains among the most widely accepted as households tend to share a common economic fate, the size of a household which is commonly not considered may off-set gains in household income.<sup id="_ref-The_American_Class_Strucutre_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_American_Class_Strucutre" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2005, the median annual household income according to the US Census Bureau was determined to be $46,326,<sup id="_ref-US_Census_Bureau_news_release_in_regards_to_median_income_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US_Census_Bureau_news_release_in_regards_to_median_income" title="">[3]</a></sup> similar to that of Canada which was roughly $41,510 (USD) in the year 2000.<sup id="_ref-Canada_Census.2C_Median_Household_income_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Canada_Census.2C_Median_Household_income" title="">[4]</a></sup> The median income per household member (including all working and non-working members above the age of 14) in the year 2003 was $23,535.<sup id="_ref-US_Census_Bureau_median_income_per_household_member_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US_Census_Bureau_median_income_per_household_member" title="">[5]</a></sup> In the year 2005, there were approximately 113,146,000 households in the United States. 17.23% of all households had annual incomes exceeding $100,000,<sup id="_ref-US_Census_2005_Economic_Survey.2C_income_data_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US_Census_2005_Economic_Survey.2C_income_data" title="">[6]</a></sup> while another 12.7% fell below the federal poverty threshold<sup id="_ref-US_Census_Bureau_press_release_regarding_poverty_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US_Census_Bureau_press_release_regarding_poverty" title="">[7]</a></sup> while the bottom 20% earned less than $19,178.<sup id="_ref-US_Census_Bureau.2C_income_quintiles.2C_2006_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US_Census_Bureau.2C_income_quintiles.2C_2006" title="">[8]</a></sup> While the aggregate income distribution tends to tilt towards the top with the top 6.37% earning roughly one third of all income, those with upper-middle incomes also controlled a large, though declining, share of the total earned income.<sup id="_ref-USAToday.2C_the_definition_of_middle_class_income_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-USAToday.2C_the_definition_of_middle_class_income" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-The_American_Class_Strucutre_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_American_Class_Strucutre" title="">[2]</a></sup> Households in the top quintile, 77% of which had two income earners, had incomes exceeding $91,705. Households in the mid quintile, with a mean of one income earner per household had incomes between $36,000 and 57,657.<sup id="_ref-US_Census_Bureau.2C_income_quintiles.2C_2006_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US_Census_Bureau.2C_income_quintiles.2C_2006" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 2005 economic survey also found that households in the top two income quintiles, those with an annual household income exceeding $55,331, had a median of two income earners while those in the lower quintiles (2nd and middle quintile) had median of only one income earner per household. Due to high <a href="../../../u/n/e/Unemployment.html" title="Unemployment">unemployment</a> among those in the lowest quintile the median number of income earners for this particular group was determined to be zero.<sup id="_ref-US_Census_2005_Economic_Survey.2C_income_data_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US_Census_2005_Economic_Survey.2C_income_data" title="">[6]</a></sup> Overall the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> followed the trend of other developed nations with a relatively large population of relatively affluent households outnumbering the poor. Among those in-between the relative extremes of the income strata a large and quite powerful section of households with moderately high middle class incomes<sup id="_ref-USAToday.2C_the_definition_of_middle_class_income_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-USAToday.2C_the_definition_of_middle_class_income" title="">[9]</a></sup> and an even larger number of households with moderately low incomes.<sup id="_ref-US_Census_2005_Economic_Survey.2C_income_data_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US_Census_2005_Economic_Survey.2C_income_data" title="">[6]</a></sup> While the median household income has increased 44% since 1990 it has decreased very slightly when considering inflation. In 1990, the median household income was determined to be $30,056; $44,603 in 2003 dollars. While personal income has remained relatively stagnant since over the past few decades, household income has risen due to the rising percentage of households with two or more income earners. Between 1999 and 2004 household income stagnated showing a slight increase since 2004.<sup id="_ref-US_Census_Bureau.2C_Median_household_income_1990_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US_Census_Bureau.2C_Median_household_income_1990" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CPI_inflation_calculator.2C_1990_USD_to_2003_USD_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CPI_inflation_calculator.2C_1990_USD_to_2003_USD" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>Households are often divided into quintiles according to their gross income. Each quintile represents 20%, or one fifth, of the population.</p>
<p>Household type is strongly correlated with household income. Married couples are disproportionately represented in the upper two quintiles, compared to the general population of households. Cross-referencing shows that this is likely due to the presence of multiple income earners in these families. Non-family households (individuals) are disproportionately represented in the lower two quintiles. Households headed by single males are disproportionately found in the middle three quintles; single females head households concentrated in the bottom three quintiles.</p>
<p>The highest income households are almost ten times as likely to own their homes rather than rent, but in the lowest quintile, the ratio of owners to renters is nearly one to one.</p>
<p>The New York Times has used the quintiles to define class. It has assigned the quintiles from lowest to highest as lower class, lower middle class, middle class, upper middle class, and upper class.<sup id="_ref-New_York_Times_definition_of_class_according_to_the_quintiles_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-New_York_Times_definition_of_class_according_to_the_quintiles" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>The change in median personal and household since 1991 also varied greatly with educational attainment. While, both the overall median personal and household icome increased since 1991, this increase did not take place on all levels of educational attainment. The overall income increased over the course of the 1990s, reaching its high in 1999, but decreasing has been ever since. In 1991 the median household income in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">US</a> was $40,873 in 2003 dollars, while the median household income in 2003 was $45,016. In 1999, however, the median household income was $46,236, 2.7% higher than today. While this trend held true for all levels of educational attainment the extend of chorinical falcutations in income were greatly influenced by educational attainment. Overall the median household and personal income decreased for those with more than a 9th grade education but less than a four-year college degree since 1991. In other words, the median household income decreased for households and individuals at the high school drop-outs and graduate, some-college, and an Associates degree level. Income did, however, increase for those with a Bachelor's degree or more. The following table shows the median household income according to the educational attainment of the householder.

These figures support the general assumption that median household income as well as the median income per member of household peaked among those households headed by middle aged persons, increasing with the age of the householder and the size of the household until the householder reaches the age of 64. With retirement income replacing salaries and the size of the household declining, the median household income decreases as well.<sup id="_ref-US_Census_Bureau_median_household_income_by_age_of_householder_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US_Census_Bureau_median_household_income_by_age_of_householder" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

<p>Since 1967, the median household income in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> has risen modestly, fluctuating several times. Even though personal income has risen substantially and 42% of all household now have two income earners, the median household income has increased only slightly. According to the US Census Bureau, this paradoxial set of trends is due to the changing structure of American households. For example, while the proportion of wives working year-round in married couple households with children has increased fron 17% in 1967 to 39% in 1996, the proportion of such households among the general population has decreased. Thus, while married couple households with children are the most economically prosperous type of household in the United, their share of the population has been dwindeling in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. In 1969, more than 40% of all households consisted of a married couple with children. By 1996 only a rough quater of US households consisted of married couples with children. As a result of these changing household demographics, median household income rose only slighly despite an ever increasing female labor force and a considerable increase in the percentage of college graduates.<sup id="_ref-Income_from_1969_to_1996.2C_US_Census_Bureau_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Income_from_1969_to_1996.2C_US_Census_Bureau" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>

<p>Overall, the median household income rose from $33,338 in 1967 to an all-time high of $44,922 in 1999, and has since decreased slightly to $43,318. Decreases in household income are visible during each recession, while increases are visible during economic upturns. These fluctuations were felt across the income strata as the incomes of both, the 95th and 20th percentile were affected by flactuations in the economy. Yet, it is important to note that income in the period between 1967 and 1999 grew faster among wealthier households than it did among poorer households. For example the household income for the 80th precentile, the lower threshold for the top quintile, rose from $55,265 in 1967 to $86,867 in 2003, a 57.2% increase. The median household income rose by 30% while the income for the 20th percentile (the lower threshold for the second lowest quitile) rose by only 28% from $14,002 to $17,984. One should note that ht majority of households in the top quintile had two income earners, versus zero for the lowest quintile and that the widening gap between the top and lowest quintile may largely be the reflection of changing household demographics including the addition of women to the workforce.<sup id="_ref-Income_and_poverty_since_1967.2C_US_Census_Bureau_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Income_and_poverty_since_1967.2C_US_Census_Bureau" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Income_from_1969_to_1996.2C_US_Census_Bureau_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Income_from_1969_to_1996.2C_US_Census_Bureau" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>

According to the US Census Bureau 2004 Community Survey, two-person households had a median income of $39,755, with $48,957 for three-person households, $54,338 for four-person households, $50,905 for five-person households, $45,435 for six-person households, with seven-or-more-person households having the second lowest median income of only $42,471.<sup id="_ref-US_Census_Bureau.2C_median_family_income_by_family_size_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US_Census_Bureau.2C_median_family_income_by_family_size" title="">[35]</a></sup>.
