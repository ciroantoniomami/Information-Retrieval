<p><b>Harvey Phillip Spector</b> (born December 26, 1940 in the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronx.html" title="Bronx">Bronx</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>) is an <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musician.html" title="Musician">musician</a> (<a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a>), <a href="../../../s/o/n/Songwriter.html" title="Songwriter">songwriter</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_producer.html" title="Record producer">record producer</a>. He is most famous as a producer. He was co-owner of Philles Records (with then-business partner Lester Sill), and later owner of Phil Spector Records.</p>
<p>Spector's <a href="../../../s/i/g/Signature.html" title="Signature">signature</a> style was called the Wall of Sound. He used large amounts of <a href="../../../e/c/h/Echo.html" title="Echo">echo</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/doubling" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:doubling">doubling</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiply.html" title="Multiply">multiplying</a> of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_instrument.html" title="Musical instrument">musical instruments</a> and the parts to be played, and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/overdub" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:overdub">overdubbing</a> of recorded parts. The built-up effect gave his records an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">operatic</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theater.html" title="Theater">theatrical</a> quality. The music sounded "bigger than life". The effect carried over especially well on <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/AM_radio" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:AM_radio">AM radio</a>, which was how most music was <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast.html" title="Broadcast">broadcast</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recording_artist.html" title="Recording artist">recording artists</a> who worked with Spector over the years included The Crystals ("Then He Kissed Me"), The Ronettes ("Be My Baby"), The <a href="../../../r/i/g/Righteous_Brothers_159a.html" title="Righteous Brothers">Righteous Brothers</a> ("You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'", <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Pitney_5646.html" title="Gene Pitney">Gene Pitney</a> ("Every Breath I Take"), Darlene Love ("(Today I Met) The Boy I'm Gonna Marry"), and Tina Turner ("River Deep, Mountain High"). Sonny Bono and Cher were among his backup singers. He married Veronica (Ronnie) Bennett of the Ronettes (who took the name Ronnie Spector).</p>
<p>Many other producers and musicians imitated the Wall of Sound style, or included elements of it in their own work, including Brian Wilson of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beach_Boys_6081.html" title="The Beach Boys">The Beach Boys</a>. Wilson thought of Spector as his biggest <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rival" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:rival">rival</a>, although the two did work together on one song, that was used in a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/public_service_announcement" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:public_service_announcement">public service announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Not all of Spector's productions became hits. One record, "He Hit Me (And It Felt Like A Kiss)" was pulled from release after complaints were made by listeners, about the song's theme. (The song was later performed by singer Courtney Love.) Another record, "This Could Be The Night" (working with both <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Nilsson_9a97.html" title="Harry Nilsson">Harry Nilsson</a> and Chip Douglas), went unreleased, although radio <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/disc_jockey" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:disc_jockey">disc jockey</a> Rodney Bingenheimer used it later as his show's <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/theme_song" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:theme_song">theme song</a>. "(Let's Dance) The Screw" was a private <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kiss-off" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:kiss-off">kiss-off</a> to Lester Sill, when his partnership with Spector ended badly, and only a few copies were pressed. "River Deep, Mountain High", which Spector thought of as his all-time best work, drew little attention in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, but it was a hit in other countries.</p>
<p>Spector's strongest work was in creating hit singles. He knew many fans never listened to the B-sides of singles, and radio seldom played them, so often his B-sides would feature an instrumental jam session, without the singers credited on the record, and with titles like "Flip and Nitty". Spector also disliked <a href="../../../a/l/b/Album.html" title="Album">albums</a>. He called them "two hit (song)s, and ten pieces of junk". When stereo became more popular than mono in recording, Spector didn't follow the trend. In later years he wore a red badge in public, with the words BACK TO MONO.</p>
<p>One of the few full albums Spector produced, <i>A Christmas Gift to You</i>, was released in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>. The album featured nearly all of the artists Spector worked with regularly. The album didn't become a hit at first, but it went on to become a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perennial.html" title="Perennial">perennial</a>. Many music listeners consider the album a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/masterpiece" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:masterpiece">masterpiece</a>.</p>
<p>Spector appeared as an <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">actor</a> a few times. One appearance was in an episode of <i>I Dream of Jeannie</i>, as a music producer. Another was in the movie <i>Easy Rider</i>, as a rich man who buys <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> from the two main characters. A character in a <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> movie, <i>Beyond the Valley of the Dolls</i>, was based on the way many people saw Spector.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> handed over the rough tapes of their unfinished <i>Get Back</i> album for Spector to post-produce, after <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Harrison_e25f.html" title="George Harrison">George Harrison</a> both worked successfully with him on "Instant Karma!'", which became a hit single for Lennon. <i>Let It Be</i> was the title for the finished album (and movie, filmed during the recording sessions). Beatles fans bought and enjoyed the album and its singles, but some fans and experts disliked portions of Spector's work. <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> hated the changes Spector made to "The Long and Winding Road", which he meant to have a simple accompaniment, but was released with a <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir.html" title="Choir">choir</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orchestra.html" title="Orchestra">orchestra</a> added. McCartney never recorded with Spector, but the other three Beatles worked with him several times, on solo recordings.</p>
<p>Spector worked less often in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, and his most notable work from those years was with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ramones_d4f9.html" title="The Ramones">The Ramones</a> and <a href="../../../y/o/k/Yoko_Ono_397a.html" title="Yoko Ono">Yoko Ono</a>, the widow of John Lennon. Spector and Ronnie were <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorced</a>, and she sued him years later for unpaid royalties from her years as a singer. She collected over a million dollars, after many years of going to court.</p>
<p>In February 2003, police were called to Spector's home (a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mansion" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:mansion">mansion</a> in Alhambra,CA.) to investigate a shooting. Actress Lana Clarkson was found dead on the grounds. Spector was charged with her <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a>. He admitted possible guilt or involvement in Clarkson's death privately, but decided to plead not guilty in court. As of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, he is free on <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bail.html" title="Bail">bail</a> and awaiting trial. <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney.html" title="Attorney">Attorney</a> Robert Shapiro was hired to defend him, but Bruce Cutler later took over the job.</p>
