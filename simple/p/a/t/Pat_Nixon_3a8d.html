<p>In Whittier, Pat Ryan met a young lawyer named Richard Nixon. He had just graduated from <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_University_c8f9.html" title="Duke University">Duke University</a>. The two became known to each other at a acting group. They also acted together in a play. They became closer and married on 21st June 1940 at in Riverside, California.</p>
<p>Richard Nixon served in the U.S. Navy during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. After the war, in 1946 Richard Nixon entered politics. He successfully ran for the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_the_United_States_f5e4.html" title="Congress of the United States">Congress of the United States</a>.</p>
<p>In 1946, she gave birth to a daughter <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tricia_Nixon_Cox_6183.html" title="Tricia Nixon Cox">Tricia Nixon Cox</a>, called Tricia. In 1948, she gave birth to her second baby, Julie Nixon Eisenhower. The Nixon couple gave a lot of time and all the affection to their daughters despite official and other engagements.</p>
<p>Her husband, Richard Nixon rose very fast during next six years. He became a member of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_of_Representatives_fcb5.html" title="United States House of Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>, then a member of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a>.

<p>The Nixon couple came to the White House in 1969. They started a tradition of inviting families to Sunday church services in the East Room of the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a>. The <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_%28United_States%29_773e.html" title="President (United States)">President</a> later discontinued these services due to concerns over the separation of Church and State. In short, separation of Church and the State says that religion and the government should remain separate from each other.</p>
<p>As the First Lady, she herself answered all her letters. Like Jacqueline Kennedy, she had an interest in adding artifacts to the White House. Her efforts brought about 600 paintings and furnishings into the White House Collection. Mrs. Nixon also arranged for a series of performances by artists at the White House. Among the guests were The Carpenters in 1972.</p>
<p>Pat Nixon went along with her husband to several other countries. Most important of such visits were to the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> in 1972 and the summit meetings in the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>.</p>
<p>She went to Peru with materials to help the victims of an earthquake. She also went to Africa and South America as the Personal Representative of the president of the United States.</p>
<p>Pat Nixon had several other personal interests. She was an avid fan of soap operas, and 'Search for Tomorrow' was her favorite.</p>
<p>In August 1974, her husband resigned as the President of the United States. People say that while her husband was making his resignation speech, Mrs. Nixon was packing their things for moving out of the White House. They left the White House on 9th August 1974. They shifted to San Clemente, California to live.</p>

<p>Her husband resigned as the President of the United States. With this, her public and social life ended. She did not appear in public often. She was a heavy smoker. Her heath became very weak. In 1976, and again in 1982, he suffered a stroke. She also got mouth cancer. She also faced problems in her spinal cord. In December 1992, when she was in a hospital, physicians found that she also had lung cancer.</p>
<p>She died at 5:45 am on 22nd June 1993 at age 81. Her husband and daughters were by her side. Her husband died about ten months later. She and President Nixon lie buried at the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, California. Her epitaph reads: "Even when people cannot speak your language, they can tell if you have love in your heart".</p>
