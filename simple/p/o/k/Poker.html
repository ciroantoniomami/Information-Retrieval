	    <p><b>Poker</b> is a game played with a standard set (or <i>deck</i>) of 52 <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playing_cards.html" title="Playing cards">cards</a>. Poker is a <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a> game, so poker players hope to win money.</p>
<p>First a person called the <i>dealer</i> gives each player a certain number of cards, called his hand. Then each player can make <i>bets</i> by putting his money in the center of the table. This stack of money is called a <i>pot</i>. After the players finish betting, the pot is given to the player with the best five cards, the best <i>hand</i>, according to the rules. To play poker, it is important to understand which hands are better than other hands.</p>
<p>There are many different kinds of poker. In draw poker, each player keeps her five cards hidden and gives away some number of cards, then takes (<i>draws</i>) new cards. In stud poker such as seven-card stud some of each player's cards are exposed (<i>face-up</i>) on the table so that other players can see them. In community card poker such as <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_hold_%27em.html" title="Texas hold 'em">Texas hold 'em</a>, players share some of their cards in the center of the table.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../p/o/k/Poker.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The history of poker is a matter of some debate. The name of the game likely descended from the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> <i>poque</i>, which descended from the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> <i>pochen</i> ('to knock'), but it is not clear whether the origins of poker itself lie with the games bearing those names. It closely resembles the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Persian</a> game of <i>as nas</i>, and may have been taught to French settlers in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a> by Persian sailors. It is commonly regarded as sharing ancestry with the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> game of <i>primero</i> and the French <i>brelan</i>. The <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> game <i>brag</i> (earlier bragg) clearly descended from <i>brelan</i> and incorporated bluffing (though the concept was known in other games by that time). It is quite possible that all of these earlier games influenced the development of poker as it exists now.</p>
<p>English actor Joseph Crowell reported that the game was played in New Orleans in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1829.html" title="1829">1829</a>, with a deck of 20 cards, four players betting on which player's hand was the most valuable. Jonathan H. Green's book, <i>An Exposure of the Arts and Miseries of Gambling</i> (G. B. Zieber, Philadelphia, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1843.html" title="1843">1843</a>), described the spread of the game from there to the rest of the country by <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi.html" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> riverboats, on which <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a> was a common pastime.</p>
<p>Soon after this spread, the full 52-card English deck was used, and the flush was introduced. During the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, many additions were made, including draw poker, stud poker (the five-card variant), and the straight. Further American developments followed, such as the wild card (around <a href="../../../1/8/7/1875.html" title="1875">1875</a>), lowball and split-pot poker (around <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>), and community card poker games (around <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>). Spread of the game to other countries, particularly in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>, is often attributed to the U.S. military.</p>
<p>The game and jargon of poker have become important parts of American culture and English culture. Such phrases as <i>ace in the hole</i>, <i>beats me</i>, <i>blue chip</i>, <i>call the bluff</i>, <i>cash in</i>, <i>pass the buck</i>, <i>poker face</i>, <i>stack up</i>, <i>up the ante</i>, <i>when the chips are down</i>, <i>wild card</i>, and others are used in everyday conversation even by those unaware of their origins at the poker table.</p>
<p>Modern tournament play became popular in American casinos after the World Series of Poker began in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>. It was also during that decade that the first serious strategy books appeared, notably <i>The Theory of Poker</i> by David Sklansky (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1880685000</a>), <i>Super System</i> by Doyle Brunson (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0931444014</a>), and <i>The Book of Tells</i> by Mike Caro (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0897461002</a>).</p>
<p>Poker’s popularity has experienced an unprecedented spike in recent years, largely due to the introduction of online poker and the invention of the hole-card camera which finally turned the game into a spectator sport. Viewers can now follow the action and drama of the game, and broadcasts of poker tournaments such as the World Series of Poker and the World Poker Tour have brought in huge audiences for cable and satellite TV distributors.</p>

<p>The game of poker is played in hundreds of variations, but the following overview of game play applies to most of them.</p>
<p>Depending on the game rules, one or more players may be required to place an initial amount of money into the pot before the cards are dealt. These are called forced bets and come in three forms: antes, blinds, and bring-ins.</p>
<p>Like most card games, the dealer shuffles the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playing_card.html" title="Playing card">deck of cards</a>. The deck is then cut, and the appropriate number of cards are dealt face-down to the players. In a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casino.html" title="Casino">casino</a> a "house" dealer handles the cards for each hand, but a <i>button</i> (any small item used as a marker, also called a <i>buck</i>) is rotated among the players to determine the order of dealing and betting in certain games. In a home game, the right to deal the cards typically rotates among the players clockwise, but a <i>button</i> may still be used.</p>
<p>After the initial deal, the first of what may be several betting rounds begins. Between rounds, the players' hands <i>develop</i> in some way, often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt. During a round of betting, there will always be a <i>current bet amount</i>, which is the total amount of money bet in this round by the player who bet last in this round. To keep better track of this, it is conventional for players to not place their bets directly into the pot (called <i>splashing</i> the pot), but rather place them in front of themselves toward the pot, until the betting round is over. When the round is over, the bets are then gathered into the pot.</p>
<p>After the first betting round is completed (every participating player having called an equal amount), there may be more rounds in which more cards are dealt in various ways, followed by further rounds of betting (into the same central pot). At any time during the first or subsequent betting rounds, if one player makes a bet and all other players fold, the deal ends immediately, the single remaining player is awarded the pot, no cards are shown, no more rounds are dealt, and the next deal begins. This is what makes it possible to bluff.</p>
<p>At the end of the last betting round, if more than one player remains, there is a showdown in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands. The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../p/o/k/Poker.html" title="Edit section: Computer players">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Computer players</span></h2>
<p>The game of poker (or at least most of the variants) is considered to be <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computational_complexity_theory.html" title="Computational complexity theory">computationally intractable</a>. However, methods are being developed to at least approximate perfect strategy from the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_theory.html" title="Game theory">game theory</a> perspective in the heads-up (two player) game, and increasingly good systems are being created for the multi-player or ring game. Perfect strategy has multiple meanings in this context. From a game-theoretic optimal point of view, a perfect strategy is a minimax one that cannot expect to lose to any other player's strategy; however, optimal strategy can vary in the presence of sub-optimal players who have weaknesses that can be exploited. In this case, a perfect strategy would be one that correctly or closely models those weaknesses and takes advantage of them to make a profit. Some of these systems are based on Bayes theorem, Nash equilibrium, Monte Carlo simulation, and Neural networks. A large amount of the research is being done at the University of Alberta by the GAMES group led by Jonathan Schaeffer who developed Poki and PsOpt.</p>
<p>A major part of the skill of live poker games, however, is guessing at the strength of a player's hand by identifying tells made by other players, while concealing one's own, unlike, for example, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a>, where all information about the game's current state is public. As a computer would not make any tells, playing against a computer would fundamentally change the nature of the game far more than in games like chess.</p>
