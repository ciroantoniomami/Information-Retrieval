	    <p><b>Pornography</b> is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art.html" title="Art">art</a> and <a href="../../../w/r/i/Writing.html" title="Writing">writing</a> intended to make people think about <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a>. Some people like to call it <i>"erotica"</i> instead, although many would say that there are differences between pornography and erotica, such as artistic properties, style, or intended use. The words <i>"sexually explicit"</i> are also used. It is also called "porn" or "porno" for short.</p>
<p>The word "pornography" comes from the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> words meaning "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">whore</a>" and "writing". It used to mean "writing about whores", and it meant stories or books that told about people having sex. Today, people usually use the word to mean <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photograph.html" title="Photograph">photographs</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movie.html" title="Movie">movies</a>, or other pictures of people who are naked or are having sex. However, books or stories about sex are sometimes also called pornography.</p>
<p>Usually, such material is called pornographic, if the only focus of it is to make people want sex. Materials, the purpose of which is not to make people crave for sex, are sometimes called erotic. A picture of a partly or completely naked person need not be pornography. It can also serve a different purpose, for example to show the difference between men and women, or to show how certain people live, mainly in <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribe.html" title="Tribe">tribe</a>-like communities.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Edit section: Kinds of pornography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kinds of pornography</span></h2>
<p>There are many kinds of pornography. Different people have different sexual likes and dislikes. Some porn shows people who are not even naked, but who are posed in a sexy manner. This is called "soft porn" -- sometimes "cheesecake" or "beefcake", depending on if women or men are in the pictures. Porn which shows people actually having sex is sometimes called "hardcore porn" or "hard porn".</p>
<p>Most pornography is intended for men. Some scientists think that men are more likely to be sexually turned on by pictures than women are. One of the most common kinds of sexually explicit writing, though, is the romance novel. These are <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novels</a> which tell stories about women falling in love and having sexual romances with exciting, passionate men. Most people who read romance novels are women. Some women also enjoy pornographic pictures or movies.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Edit section: The business of pornography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The business of pornography</span></h2>
<p>From the earliest years of the invention of the camera and motion pictures, there have been companies making pornography. However, until the 1970s, companies making pornography were small, because there were many laws against making pornography. In the 1970s, pornographic magazines such as Penthouse became a huge and successful business. As well, in the 1970s, pornographic films became more mainstream. In the 1980s, the development of the video cassette recorder caused a huge boom in the pornography industry. A number of companies began producing hardcore pornographic sex videotapes in the US and distributing the tapes to home viewers. In the 1990s, as more people began using of the Internet, and as computers became more powerful, companies began selling pornographic pictures on the Internet. In the 2000s, the increased speed of computers allowed pornography companies to sell porn videos over the Internet that are send electronically to the purchasers computer.</p>
<p>There are many different kinds of businesses that make and sell pornography. There are <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magazine.html" title="Magazine">magazines</a> such as Playboy and Hustler; movie production companies such as Vivid Video which hire pornography actors and produce porn videos; and also many thousands of <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_site.html" title="Web site">Web sites</a> that produce and sell porn. Businesses that make pornography call themselves <i>adult entertainment</i> businesses. This is because most people think only <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult.html" title="Adult">adults</a> should see pornography, and that it is not good for <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child.html" title="Child">children</a> to see it. In some countries it is a crime to sell or show pornography to children.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Edit section: Pornography and the law">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pornography and the law</span></h2>
<p>In very many countries, it is serious crime to make pornographic photographs of children. This is called "child porn". In the United States, for instance, there are laws that say that anyone who takes pornographic photos must keep records that prove the ages of the people in the pictures are over 18.</p>
<p>In many countries, such as <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>, or <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> making or owning pornography is a crime. However, in some cultures, such as <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Europe_1e16.html" title="Western Europe">Western European</a> nations and the US, making or owning pornography is legal, as long as all of the participants are older than a certain age, and as long the pornographic material is not sold or shown to people below that age. Very often this age is 18 years.<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Netherlands_cf8a.html" title="The Netherlands">The Netherlands</a> have very liberal laws regarding pornography. Many cities or towns have restrictions on where pornographic videos or magazines can be sold, and on how these videos or magazines can be displayed. For example, some towns in Canada require pornographic video packages to be kept out of sight of children.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Edit section: Criticism of pornography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism of pornography</span></h2>
<p>Since the 1970s, many women's groups and feminist writers have criticized pornography, especially hardcore pornography. Women's groups and feminist writers have argued that hardcore pornography shows women in degrading or humiliating positions. These critics of hardcore pornography have also argued that hardcore pornography encourages the viewers of the films or magazines to act violently to real women they meet.</p>
<p>From the other side, pornography is also often criticised by those who believe that it is ungodly.</p>
<p>In some famous <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novels</a>, like <i><a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteen_Eighty-Four_808a.html" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></i> by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a>, pornography has been described as a tool that is secretly pushed by some evil <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">governments</a>, because they believe it is a force that makes the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public.html" title="Public">public</a> less likely to rebel, or even to care about injustice. In fact, Orwell got this idea from what some countries such as <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> had really done. A short time after <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> came to power, Germany was flooded with tax-funded pornography like never before.</p>
