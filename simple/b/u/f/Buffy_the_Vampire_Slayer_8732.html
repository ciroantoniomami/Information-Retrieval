<p><i><b>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</b></i> is an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_programme.html" title="Television programme">show</a>. It is about a girl who fought <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire.html" title="Vampire">vampires</a> and other <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monster.html" title="Monster">monsters</a>. It was written by <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joss_Whedon_368c.html" title="Joss Whedon">Joss Whedon</a>. He based it on a <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html" title="Film">movie</a> with the same title that he wrote. The movie came out in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> and starred <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristy_Swanson_a06d.html" title="Kristy Swanson">Kristy Swanson</a>, Luke Perry, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Sutherland_786c.html" title="Donald Sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Reubens_6240.html" title="Paul Reubens">Paul Reubens</a>. It was not very <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular.html" title="Popular">popular</a>. The television show had many <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan.html" title="Fan">fans</a>. It was shown from <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> until <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>.</p>
<p>The main <a href="../../../i/d/e/Idea.html" title="Idea">idea</a> of the show is the opposite of what is the normal <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> idea about horror. In <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tradition.html" title="Tradition">traditional</a> Hollywood horror stories, the young blonde girl is always the weak character. She is always the one that needs to be saved. She is often the first one to <a href="../../../d/i/e/Die.html" title="Die">die</a>. In <i>Buffy</i>, Whedon changed that. He changed that girl into the person with all the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power.html" title="Power">power</a>. He changed her into the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hero.html" title="Hero">hero</a>. Many of the monsters and storylines on the show are <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbol.html" title="Symbol">symbols</a> of real-life problems faced by <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teenager.html" title="Teenager">teenagers</a>. As Whedon has said, "Highschool is a horror movie."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> was first shown on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">March 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> on the WB <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_network.html" title="Television network">network</a>. It was a very important part of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._b6cc.html" title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_network.html" title="Television network">television network</a> in its early years.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> After five seasons, the show left the WB and went to the United Paramount Network (<a href="../../../u/p/n/UPN_2d96.html" title="UPN">UPN</a>) for its last two seasons. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the entire series was shown on Sky One and BBC2. The BBC showed the show at two different times. A <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family.html" title="Family">family</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/i/Friend.html" title="Friend">friendly</a> <a href="../../../v/e/r/Version.html" title="Version">version</a> with <a href="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/violence" class="extiw" title="wikt:violence">violence</a> and bad <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a> cut out was shown early in the evening and an unedited version was shown later at night.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Sky One did something similar. It showed an edited version in the after-noon and the uncut version at prime-time. From the fourth season onwards, the BBC showed the show in anamorphic 16:9 <a href="../../../w/i/d/Widescreen.html" title="Widescreen">widescreen</a> format, but Whedon said that <i>Buffy</i> was never susposed to be watched this way. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>The main <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">character</a> was Buffy Summers. She was played by <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar_8a56.html" title="Sarah Michelle Gellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>.

Buffy's Watcher was a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> man named Giles. With the help of Giles and her friends, Xander and Willow, Buffy fought a different monster every episode.</p>
<p>Buffy and her friends went to <a href="../../../s/c/h/School.html" title="School">school</a> at Sunnydale <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">High School</a>. They appear normal to their <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family.html" title="Family">families</a> while killing vampires and monsters at night.</p>
<p>Not all vampires were evil in the show. One vampire was named Angel. He was given his <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a> back by a <a href="../../../g/y/p/Gypsy.html" title="Gypsy">gypsy</a> <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse.html" title="Curse">curse</a>.

The curse took his soul away when they had <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> for the first time. This caused Angel to become evil. When Angel got back his soul, he knew that he and Buffy could not be together because he might lose it again. Angel left Sunnydale and went to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. The television series <i><a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel_%28TV_series%29_7f24.html" title="Angel (TV series)">Angel</a></i> tells the story of what happened to him after he left.</p>

When he died, the Council sent Giles to Sunnydale to become her watcher. In the past, Giles used magic and had a lot of <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge.html" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> about demons and vampires.</p>

<p>Joss Whedon uses several themes thoughout his works. These are often found in the writing done for <i>Buffy</i>.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong female characters</b>: As a supporter of <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a>, Whedon likes to create teenage girls with <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">superpowers</a>. Many of the most powerful characters in the series are female. Buffy and Willow are examples.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Homosexuality</b>: Whedon uses <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">gay</a> characters for both major parts (Willow and Tara) and minor parts (Larry Blaisdall and Scott Hope).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Witty dialogue</b>:The dialogue in Joss Whedon's shows and movies is notable It often has rapid-fire wit and pop culture references. Some are easy to notice other are more difficult.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Death</b>: No one is safe in a story writen by Whedon. Major characters can die at any time. Minor characters die more often. In a world with magic, not all deaths are forever though. Buffy herself died at least 4 times and was brought back. Tara McKay, Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principal.html" title="Principal">Principal</a> Snyder were all regular characters that died and did not return. Other characters such as Harmony Kendall died and came back as vampires.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Relationships</b>: A good <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance.html" title="Romance">romantic</a> <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relationship.html" title="Relationship">relationship</a> makes for a bad story. Whedon does not like relationships that have a happy ending. Every relationship in the show ended badly.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Angel and Buffy: Angel loses his soul and turns evil.</dd>
<dd>Spike and Buffy: Spike tries to <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> Buffy. In the end, Spike dies to save the world.</dd>
<dd>Willow and Tara: Tara is shot and killed.</dd>
<dd>Xander and Anya: They breakup at the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">alter</a>. Anya dies in the end.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Family</b>: In a Whedon story, <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family.html" title="Family">family</a> is not who you were born to. Family is who you chose to be with. In <i>Buffy</i>, Buffy, Giles, Willow and Xander, as well as the others with them, were more of a family than any of their <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biological</a> families.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Fatherhood</b>: Fathers in Whedon's stories are almost always shown badly. Buffy's father left her mother and her. He is rarely talked about or seen in the series. Xander's father is always shown as being abusive. Father figures replace the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional.html" title="Traditional">traditional</a> father in the same way Whedon replaced the traditional family. Giles takes the place of the father in <i>Buffy</i>. At times, even he is shown badly in the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role.html" title="Role">role</a>.</li>
