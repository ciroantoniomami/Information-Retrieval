<dd>That was the one. Now that I think about it, it's probably not as 'black &amp; white' as color/colour or kilometer/kilometre. And I guess I can't really speak to common/colloquial usage in Britain, but I can't imagine a US school teacher accepting 'learnt' as a correct spelling, but I was led to believe that 'learnt' is what is taught in UK schools (like 'spelt')--I guess it's possible that's changed more recently. Anyway, it sounds like you are aware of the issue, and had reasons to change it anyway, so I won't worry about it (I actually like 'learned' better also, but I assume that is my personal bias based on living my entire life in the US). Especially on EN I've seen so many people "correct" the more concrete ones, like colour to color, that apparently I've developed something of a 'knee jerk' reaction to similar changes. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 19:13, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why did you revert my edits and list it as minor? It would only be minor if it was vandalism, and it wasn't. Although I'm not a Marxist, to say his ideas do not work are POV, especially when many Marxists don't think his ideas were ever put into practice fully. I actually think his ideas don't work, but it is still POV to say that in an article. Anarchists (at least the vast, vast majority) oppose capitalism, and the ones that don't are often not viewed as part of the anarchist movement. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 18:27, 15 April 2006 (UTC)\</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't mean to imply vandalism by marking 'minor', I thought this could be done for any revert... I know that most anarchists do oppose capitalism, and wasn't trying to revert that edit, as much as the deletion of "because Marx's ideas did not work"... But I see how that could be construed as pov, so maybe it would be more factual in light of what you pointed out above, to write instead "because Marx's ideas were never _made to_ work"...? <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 20:19, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, the minor is only for reverting clear cases of vandalism or fixing small grammatical or spelling errors. In fact, engaging in too many reverts is called an edit war, and that is definetely not minor.

<p>I hope that you do not mind me adding things in simple English. I was banned from English Wikipedia for correcting the Port Arthur massacre article there. I thought it was very unfair. I provided references, while the people that banned me just made things up. I think it would be good if that article could be accurately presented. I have written many articles showing how Wikipedia have covered up that article. If you look at the first entry, the first entry is a redirect to something that does not exist. The first talk entry was one apologising for something beforehand. There are over 100 entries that have been deleted from history. This is something that I would have hoped that something like Wikitruth could have exposed. This is actual censorship. And they have banned people for trying to speak truth and trying to improve accuracy. This is all that I have ever aimed to do. I have an article on these censored topics on Wikinfo too, with Fred Bauder's permission. These are important topics, and I do not think that it is right that we are going to lie to people about it. I do not care about the politics of Wikipedia, about the cabal or whatever else. I just want people to tell the truth. 203.122.215.44 04:17, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The truth is all I'm after, but we can't put on the whole trial here. In cases where there are two sides to the story, usually the solution is to give each side's main points, not including only one side, or cutting out one side, and more or less proportional to the actual representation of that view in the public. You say that most people agree with your version, but has anyone established this, say with a poll or something? I can maybe see an article that gives both sides of the story. Even the English version mentions that there are other views, and gives links to websites of opposing views. That seems fair to me. Then there is even the question of whether topics like this (a retarded person convicted of going on a shooting spree) are at all necessary or appropriate for this encyclopedia project. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 04:30, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Being the single greatest mass murder in Australian history is notable. 35 people killed total, 32 in a single day. The next highest is 15. That makes it notable. Sure, there's only 21 million people in Australia, but its a decent enough size. That is what makes it notable. The event also had major influence in politics. They changed the gun laws purely because of this, which in turn meant that John Howard stayed as leader (he was behind in the polls before this). They also changed the law to allow for his money ($28 million, I believe) to be given to victims. I didn't put in the figures because I couldn't find a source for it, but yes, that was significant. It was also one of the greatest trial by media examples in the history of the world. Never has a person been so demonised in the media since Adolf Hitler. It is probably 2nd in terms of the most controversial result in world history, after the JFK assassination, and is the number 1 most controversial story in Australian history. Whether this is encyclopaedic is not an issue. The issue is how to tell it. Nowhere outside of the English Wikipedia is there such a biased, inaccurate version which fails to acknowledge the enormous outcry about the verdict. Wikipedia goes further than just blatantly stating the official story. They have lied about people like a Mrs Larner, they have misquoted text, such as about his diagnosis and about the trial by media issue. They have falsely stated that he confessed. It is just quite simply a load of nonsense. Acknowledging an opposing view is one thing. But stating that opposing view as a "baseless conspiracy theory" is another. And failing to acknowledge the name and identity of the person who started the "conspiracy theory", as being Wendy Scurr, the chief eye witness and first person to report the murder to police, is misleading. Wikipedia has said that all eye witnesses said he did it. In fact, no eye witnesses said that he did it. We can't argue NPOV. This is a blatant falsehood. We have hard and fast evidence that eye witnesses said that he didn't do it. Whilst its not unusual for police to just arrest "someone" (see Ivan Milat and the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpacker_murders.html" title="Backpacker murders">Backpacker murders</a> as another example of this - or Bradley John Murdoch and the disappearance of <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Falconio_995b.html" title="Peter Falconio">Peter Falconio</a> as another), rather than properly investigate a case, the sheer notoriety of this case makes it notable. It was a cover up. One of the greatest cover ups in the history of the world. Wikipedia, sadly, fails to acknowledge all of the evidence of this, and instead have worsened the cover up. I have written many articles exposing this cover up, if you want to see them. But things that I have written are not allowed to be used in Wikipedia, per their rules on citations, so we have to leave them out. I think that what I wrote was very neutral and very accurate. If you disagree, feel free to edit it a little. 203.122.215.44 06:20, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see what you are saying about a "poll". As far as I know, they have never done a poll. So I shortened it to "95% of articles written oppose the official story". You can prove this using Google. It is very easy to do, and is quite accurate. Of course, this was an example of trial by media, so most likely there are many people who do not know much about it that blindly believe the official story. Especially since En Wikipedia's article. At the 10 year anniversary, on 28 April 2006, over 90% of attendees were reported stating that Martin Bryant didn't do it. This was picked up repeatedly by the media, and there were numerous reports stating this. 90% or 95% does not seem to me like a "baseless conspiracy theory" and I think it is inaccurate to state it as such. It is a majority of people who support this. However, there are about 1,000 different theories as to what really happened. So in terms of theories which are believed, we can say that the official story is probably amongst the top 5 most commonly believed theories. It just depends on how good you are at manipulating statistics. On a similar issue: how many people believe that Lee Harvey Oswald killed John Fitzgerald Kennedy? It's the same kind of issue. A cover up is obvious. The truth is not so obvious. 203.122.215.44 07:31, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why are my edits being deleted as unsuitable? Wikipedia has articles on the Donkey Punch and the Dirty Sanchez, and it also has real anatomical photographs. I think that information should be free and available in simple english, and that these articles represent a serious deficiency in the quality of information available on the simple english wikipedia.</p>

<p>Please beleive me, I didn't mean that to be the final version, or to white wash his crimes. I just wanted to bring it to a more neutral level, and I think that we can agree neither version is neutral. I understand that he was responsible for millions of deaths. Some of what was said seemed to be a very POV exaggeration, and I realize I probably went too far in the other direction. So can we compromise, instead of reverting everything the other person tries to add?

<dd>Hi, sorry about me having to hurry cuz I had to go to church but now I think I could talk now. Well about Chacor, I knew about him from the english wiki for a long time but had somewhat of a bad relationships between eachother and had conflicts frequently; since he'd usually critize my ideas and edits and call them vandalism although they were rather good-faith edits. So as a result, I recently "quit" that wiki (not actually leave, but shut-down all activity), and moved here for a fresh start until he came again so I worried about it and began freaking out. --<a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">§</a> <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlastor_Moody_bdf3.html" title="User:Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a> <sub>(<a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlastor_Moody_93d5.html" title="User talk:Alastor Moody">T</a> + <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alastor_Moody_3295.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alastor Moody">C</a>)</sub> 23:47, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't understand Chacor, if yu wish to come and help over here, how come yu have to give bad first impressions to other users that didn't do anything at first and call other user's edits "unnecessary", cause this wiki is not to make conflicts (espeically what happedned before between you and me in en wiki) cuz I don't want that in here. You made me abandon the genral English Wikipedia, but do yu now wish me to leave this wiki also, cuz I'll have no choice but go say bye-bye and go to myspace.com instead.

<p>Hi. Thanks for the advice. The majority of the edits I made, though, were of a (I believe) completely uncontroversial nature. Mostly grammar and wording fixes. I made a little factual correction to <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chocolate.html" title="Chocolate">Chocolate</a> and added a sentence to <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a> that probably I should have waited for.

<p>Hi again. Under what policy criteria did you delete Image:Spoken Atheism.ogg? I am not too familiar with policy on simple, having only just started here, on normal EN, it would have been marked for a deletion discussion. You could have simply de-linked it from the page, and waited for a while. You also reverted the textual addition to <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a>. May I ask on what grounds? That it wasn't referenced? By that criteria, most of simple would have to removed. Since I don't want to revert you, I'll cite it now for you, if you like so that you can add it back:</p>

<p>Hi, today on simple.wiki a vandal was creating useless pages and I had to seek for help from a Steward. He did let me block the vandal and clean up the mess, then removed my temp admin status. Later, he was also informed that there is a pending RFA on this wiki for User:TangoTango and the Steward asked the user to put his request for sysop's flag on meta and therefore gave him the adminship, since the only active bureaucrat doesn't seem willing to do that.

<dd>It is, admittedly, rather difficult to follow changes to each article&#160;;) However, it's quite useful (if not necessary) if the article has been merged via copy-and-paste, I think. I guess the real objective is to make sure each piece of text can be attributed to the correct author - if you don't merge, you have to delve through two histories (the other of which may not be present if the article is subsequently copied to a non-Wikipedia site) to find the author of a piece of the text from the merged article, while with the merged history, you can be sure to find it there. -- <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETangotango_2487.html" title="User:Tangotango">Tangotango</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETangotango_e3e5.html" title="User talk:Tangotango">talk</a>) 14:04, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In my attempt to merge, I tried to preserve all the text that was there. I basically copied over (and commented out) that part of the one, from the 18... source.

<p>Hello Blockinblox. Thank you very much for the trust you place in me. Yes, it was unfortunate that I did not make it to admin at the start of this year. At that time however, I had considerably more free time I could put into Wikipedia. Now I do between 200 and 400 edits a month, and I feel bad about it.

<p>Hello Blockinbox. Yes it seem that the community has finally placed some trust in me, and made me an Admin. I will try to fulfill those administrative duties as best I can. I am still unclear on how to create archives of pages, but for the rest, as you can see I am already fulfilling my duties (mainly cleaning nonsense pages, and doing requested deletions).

<p>Hi, you said earlier on to Tdxiang that we could desysop him. Actually, we can't. They decided a few months ago that bureaucrats couldn't be trusted with removal of access and took that privilege away. All removals need to go to the stewards now, all we can do is grant sysop, bureaucrat and bot flags and change usernames.

<p>Ok, so we have already confirmed that Kimberly Ashton and AbbyItalia work from the same IP. However, what about User:Yehku Yehklucs Yehklann and (and possibly User:Terikron Tiraldi)? The first thing that the first user did was vandalize the IP's user page, accusing sockpuppetry. This seems somewhat odd that somebody would know that much who isn't an insider or was here before...so this person may be Ashton/Abby herself. Again, this is only a hunch, but I think it may be worth mentioning. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">PullToOp</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">n</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">Talk</a></sup> 03:11, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From the view point of categories, User:71.231.130.56 is an obvious match to Abby.

<p>I personally just don't like using the special page for the cat tree. That's why I tossed the link to the stats concise cats page. The special page takes up too much page space for basic info while the concise list can cover the first two subcats in much less space making it easier to get a good location for a jump off point when looking for the best cat. True, the special page is constantly updated while the Concise list is a month or more old, but there really isn't a lot of movement on the top level categories. Using the concise list as links to the cats themselves to explore the lower cats when needed (does cat:English people have a subcat for English explorers? for example) is easier with the concise list when dealing with hundreds of entries a day. It may just be a matter of taste. -- <font face="ariel" color="#770044"><b><a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreol_5a8b.html" title="User:Creol">Creol</a></b></font> 06:08, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I understand that I have made a mistake by re-posting deleted articles, but why being so critical on this topic. If you are not interested in vibrators, there are other people for sure, who can't fluently speak English and are interested to find out, what a G-spot vibrator means. I see I'm not the only one who's suffered of this. So how about just reverting the edits and placing them for voting, or whatever. I may not be perfectly familiar with all the policies, but what I know for sure, is that wikipedia is a <b>COMMUNITY</b> and not <b>DICTATORSHIP</b>. If the community agrees that I turn the wikipedia into a porn forum, I'll contribute with something else.

<p>Hi, Blockinblox. I've seen you around a lot but I don't believe I've had the chance to chat with you yet. I think you might want to have another look at <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Be-In_d6f7.html" title="Human Be-In">Human Be-In</a>. I don't want to simply revert without explaining my reasoning because I respect you. If you look at what I took out, you might see that it is extraneous info, not needed to understand the context of the event. Also, the article was full of long, complex, run-on sentences. I believe the changes you made have again made the article unnecessarily complex. I simplified the sentences that I felt contained pertinent info. I removed sentences that didn't have anything to do with the event. In particular, I think the sentence about <i>"The recent <a href="../../../n/o/v/November.html" title="November">November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> elections to Congress were a setback for the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democrat.html" title="Democrat">Democrats</a>, with more and more people unhappy about the war and the riots, and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Republican_Party_faa7.html" title="United States Republican Party">Republicans</a> finally succeeded in getting the first African American <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">Senator</a> elected since the Reconstruction"</i> is not needed at all in this article. Perhaps you could give it another look? Thanks, <a href="../../../t/y/g/User%7ETygartl1_4fd2.html" title="User:Tygartl1">Tygartl1</a> 16:00, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I will go ahead and leave the info in although I still feel it disrupts the flow of the page somewhat. I will try to simplify the sentences though since they are still a little long for a simple page. I hope you don't feel like I stepped on your toes. At second glance, I can see how my edits could have been construed as reckless, but I assure you I thought long and hard about my edits before I made them.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/y/g/User%7ETygartl1_4fd2.html" title="User:Tygartl1">Tygartl1</a> 16:59, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
