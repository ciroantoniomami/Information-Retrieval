<p>I've read the discussion below and cannot really understand why American spellings are used. This is Wikipedia and sources should be taken seriously. In the original publication of this list British spelling is used, that's a simple fact. The spelling should be changed accordingly. The current list violates Wikipedia principles. 89.56.195.163 19:14, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This page is not a historical document. It is the list of words preferred on this Wikipedia. It does make sense that a single spelling is preferreed here. As the US spellings are, in general, closer to the phonetic pronunciations of these words I believe it is appropriate to use those spellings and I speak as one born and brought in Ireland and living in the UK.193.82.249.131 11:03, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Concerning the claim that Ogden's list uses U.S. spellings:<br />
That's simply not correct. Ogden was a British linguist and he used (obviously) British English.<br />
See <a href="http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/begr.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/begr.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. He worked in CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND.<br />
See also <a href="http://www.bckelk.uklinux.net/words/basic.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bckelk.uklinux.net/words/basic.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, for the original list from Ogden's book. 202.32.3.147 04:20, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC) Please note that the website <a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/" class="external free" title="http://ogden.basic-english.org/" rel="nofollow">http://ogden.basic-english.org/</a> is NOT affiliated with Ogden. It's a U.S. institution, which is probably why they dropped the U.K. spellings in the lists. Since Ogden's world list is a historical document, it should be quoted exactly "as is", according to Wikipedia guidelines. However, U.S. spellings are so common that is o.k. to include them.<br />
But the approach to use U.S. ONLY cannot be justified.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Neither source you quote is authoritative, and their spellings are in the minority of Basic English usage today. Even if you produce a scanned page from an original Ogden book showing British spelling, it is irrelevant. <i>Modern</i> Basic English uses American spelling only. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 17:55, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Very funny. Even if I produce a scanned page... it's "irrelevant"? Let me summarize what you're saying here:
<ul>
<li>Ogden's original list doesn't use British spellings (claim from history page): Wrong.</li>
<li>You seem to be of the opinion that you can change spellings of historical documents. This clearly violates Wikipedia policy. How about converting Shakespeare texts to common U.S. usage, because it's more "common"?</li>
<li>Wikipedia accepts both U.S. and U.K. spellings. See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>You call U.K. spellings a minority. Maybe they are, but it's a huge (!) minority: U.K., Australia, Ireland, India, South Africa, Canada (with some exceptions) and the rest of the Commonwealth, the European Union, the United Nations (U.K. official standard!), the WTO, ISO, NATO, IOC (Olympic Movement)...</li>
<li>You say my quotes are not "authoritative". But you are authoritative, I guess? You seem to be the King ruling these pages. "Modern Basic English uses American spelling only." Interesting. Who says that? Ogden, the inventor and only true authority regarding Basic English, whould probably find this statement quite outrageous.<br /></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>That's your personal opinion! When I searched for "modern basic english", I didn't find a single page. I found that quite amusing. It's called "Ogden's Basic English". There is no classification, like "old" - "modern".<br />
<br /></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I never said that I wanted to get rid of U.S. spellings in the lists.<br /></dd>
<dd>Even in American dictionaries, it's perfectly normal to give U.K. variants. That's all I'm asking for. Maybe you don't like "color/colour"? Maybe "color/colour" or "color (colour)" is better? Well, fine.<br /></dd>
<dd>You might be wondering why I insist on alternative spellings? I think it is not acceptable that you take a British word list, published by a British linguist, Americanize it and proclaim: "This is the INTERNATIONAL standard." Because it simply isn't. 202.32.3.147 07:30, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The list was not made by me, though I did format it. It is taken from <a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/" class="external free" title="http://ogden.basic-english.org/" rel="nofollow">http://ogden.basic-english.org/</a> which seems to be very authoritative. I don't care about American/British spellings, only that the list reflect Basic English usage as documented by the most authoritative source. Your changes are not supported by documentation. Keep in mind that even though <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style" rel="nofollow">en:wikipedia</a> accepts both spellings does not mean that this Wikipedia does. That policy is for us to decide. These word lists are not to be changed lightly in order to placate your spelling sensibilities. Find a source which supports the assertion that Basic English usage allows both usages, then come back. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 18:54, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's true, <a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/" class="external free" title="http://ogden.basic-english.org/" rel="nofollow">http://ogden.basic-english.org/</a> is the main site about Basic English on the net. However, if it was a British or Australian website, they would definitely use different spellings. On <a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/intlworj.html" class="external free" title="http://ogden.basic-english.org/intlworj.html" rel="nofollow">http://ogden.basic-english.org/intlworj.html</a>, the following sentence makes it quite clear, that even this website (which you call authoritative), accepts spelling variants: "For ease of understanding in the digital age, I have allowed the spell checker to change spelling to "Microsoft American." There may be slight spelling and pronunciation differences around the world - the British may include some silent letters; the French may add accents, the Dutch will no doubt double some letters - but the words should be understandable." By the way, I doubt that Ogden would have liked his list to be changed to "Microsoft American". It don't care about Dutch/French variations, but since this is a Simple <i>English</i> wikipedia, and British English is a major international variety of English, BrE variants should be included. The "B" in BASIC stands for "British" by the way.<br /></dd>
<dd>Besides, I noticed that "aluminum" is the only spelling in the "International Basic English Wordlist". However "aluminum" is only used in the U.S. and Canada. The official (IUPAC-favored) international spelling is "aluminium". How international is an "international wordlist" that only includes a regional spelling?</dd>
<dd>You asked for sources: Well, first of all Ogden himself. He's the inventor, the original source, actually, the only authority.<br /></dd>
<dd>Here are some links with different spellings from various countries: <a href="http://www.xiaolai.net/ogden/850BASIC.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xiaolai.net/ogden/850BASIC.txt" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://www.langmaker.com/wordlist/basiclex.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.langmaker.com/wordlist/basiclex.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://rowa.giso.de/languages/english/basic-english/basic_english.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://rowa.giso.de/languages/english/basic-english/basic_english.pdf" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://www.redbird.jp/ky_office/publications/basic_sfc.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.redbird.jp/ky_office/publications/basic_sfc.pdf" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://www.twt.edu.cn/netclass/english/yingyudiye.php?recid=725&amp;dir=%CD%F8%C9%CF%BF%CE%CC%C3-" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.twt.edu.cn/netclass/english/yingyudiye.php?recid=725&amp;dir=%CD%F8%C9%CF%BF%CE%CC%C3-" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></dd>
<dd>Now, considering all these points, you should admit, that adding variants is fine. After all, it's only <i>additional</i> information for just a few words, less than 1%. The U.S. spellings are not changed. By the way, I'm a Germany university student. I learned British English at school and later American English. I like both. The reason why I'm arguing with you is that I'm a strong supporter of language neutrality. 202.32.3.147 07:39, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>One more thing I noticed while reading the International word list. It uses "meter" and "liter". Now, you may not be used to the spellings "metre" and "litre", but consider the following:<br /></dd>
<dd>The only English-speaking country not using the metric system in daily life and business is the U.S. And the U.S. is also the only country to spell "meter" and "liter". Now, do you really think it is justified to include only "meter" and "liter" in the list, when no English-speaking country using these units spells them this way?&#160;:-) 202.32.3.147 07:39, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Nevertheless it appears that Ogden supported American spelling for BASIC English (and in fact any spelling reform in principle). The following interesting footnote appears in BASIC English: International Second Language (<a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/isl111.html#ednote" class="external free" title="http://ogden.basic-english.org/isl111.html#ednote" rel="nofollow">http://ogden.basic-english.org/isl111.html#ednote</a>) as footnote 10...</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Although Ogden refused to associate Basic with any movement for spelling reform, he was, of course, prepared to accept whatever could be accomplished, and he recommended that "wherever possible without arousing prejudice, the changes already achieved in America should be extended to the rest of the English-speaking world." Accordingly, in The Basic Words as here printed in Section Two, the American spellings, behavior, color, harbor, humor, and plow will be found.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It was written by the editor for the 1968 edition and seems to pretty conclusively prove that we should be using American spelling if we are to follow Ogden's own intentions.</p>
<p>It's a footnote to the following paragraphs...</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A chief obstacle to the spread of English has hitherto been its phonetic irregularity, the frequency with which the same symbols are used to represent different sounds, and the uncertainties of stress. There is the fact that the word fish, as Sir Richard Paget has noted, might appear as ghoti (gh as in enough, etc.); and if dealt with in the same way foolish might be spelled in 613,975 different ways.</i></dd>
<dd><i>To master such details in a vocabulary of 20,000 words, or even 2,000, necessitates an amount of drudgery which has given phoneticians and advocates of synthetic languages their opportunity. With the Basic vocabulary, however, such irregularities are reduced to a minimum in which, by treating each word as an individual, the learner can even profit by its peculiar appearance in written form as an aid to memory, and historical continuity can thus be preserved. The 850 sounds being fixed by the gramophone records, their written forms can be memorized as individual entities, with no special emphasis on any principle but that of stress.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Phonetic (spelling) reform can thus be left to pursue its separate path. It may find Basic a useful ally, and Basic may later profit by its progress. Hence the importance of Basic for educational work which cannot allow itself to be involved in controversies such as any violent departure from the habits of centuries must always engender.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>...which again appear to support the case that Ogden liked the idea of spelling reform in principle, American or otherwise. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> 07:27, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be better to move this to Wikipedia:Ogden's Basic Worldlist and keep it as the original list, and then have something editable at this page, where alternative spellings etc can be added? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 19:25, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On another page, it says: "Foreigners found they could indeed learn it as quickly as advertised. They liked it (except for the spelling, which Ogden refused to agree to reform.)"<br /></dd>
<dd>Derek, it makes sense to include US spelling, if it's true that Ogden really said that (the quote you presented). But it's probably a quote from later in his life. In the original publication, he didn't use US spelling.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>In the US constitution, British spelling is used, by the way. You could say as well: "Today the founding fathers would use US spellings", so let's change the Constitution. But it wasn't changed, because it's an historical document. Just as Ogden's word list. Including both US and British spellings should really be no problem. And as outlined with "metre": it simple doesn't make sense to say that Basic English should only use "meter", when in every single English-speaking country where the metric system is actually used, it's spelled "metre". In fact, the international standard is "metre", see <a href="http://www.bipm.org/en/convention/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bipm.org/en/convention/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> 202.32.53.38 05:13, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Funnily enough, I don't have a strong axe to grind on this subject and don't really care which spelling is used. I just thought that it would be helpful to those who do care, if I had a look for some evidence on what Ogden really thought, since both sides seemed to be guessing about it. When we combine the note that I discovered (<i>"wherever possible <b>without arousing prejudice</b>, the changes already achieved in America should be extended to the rest of the English-speaking world."</i>) and the note that you discovered, (<i>"They liked it (except for the spelling, which Ogden refused to agree to reform.)"</i>), plus the fact that the original publication used unreformed spelling, it seems to reinforce the point that Ogden liked the idea of spelling reform in principle but was not prepared to use it in practice (over and above the limited reforms already accepted by the American public) for fear of jeopardising the progress of BASIC English. What a sensible fellow! Let us likewise not allow the issue of spelling to compromise the progress of this Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> 20:56, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Apparently some users believe that Basic English is from the US and have thus created word lists using the American spellings. This is of course incorrect. A look at the original publications reveals of course, the British spelling is used. Why such a long discussion about this?

<p>I'm on Wikipedia as SBHarris, and just discovered Simple English Wikipedia. Kick me if this has been suggested someplace else, but it occurs to me that what simple English Wikipedia needs, is a lot of robotic flagging of articles to see which of their component words are part of the Basic English 850, or 1500, or derivatives thereof(a much longer list). The output might give words in three different colors, for example.</p>
<p>It would be most useful if a user had some way of running the `bot repetitively on an article, while editing it. The best place for the bot to run in the background, would obviously be to have it run every time the user did a "show preview." Results would come up very much like the "linked" or "unlinked" colors now used for THOSE purposes.</p>
<p>Without a lot of experience, it's quite difficult for the average native English speaker to tell if words beyond a certain complexity are part of the BE 850 or 1500. However, with these things automatically flagged by bot, it IS easy even for inexperienced people to spot target words outside basic English, and then to make a decision if there is some shorter and more basic replacement that works as well, or if the word needs to stand "as is."</p>
<p>Won't one of your considerate 'bot makers consider working on this? It really would change <i>everything</i> here.</p>
