<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpacker_murders.html" title="Edit section: What happened">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">What happened</span></h2>
<p>7 people were found in Belangalo State Forest. Some of these people were visiting Australia. Some of these people were visiting Sydney from other parts of Australia. Some of these people were from Sydney. Some of these people were by themselves. Some of these people were with a friend. The 7 people were all different from each other.</p>
<p>On the <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_271d.html" title="TV">TV</a> they said that <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourist.html" title="Tourist">tourists</a> were killed, but not everyone who died was a tourist.</p>
<p>The 7 people were found all over Belangalo State Forest, which is a big area. Some of them had their heads chopped off. Someone had sex with some of them. Some of them had their clothes taken off. Some of them were wearing clothes that belonged to other ones. Some of them had bits of their bodies cut off and put somewhere else. Some of the bodies were mixups of other bodies. Some of the bodies were by themselves.</p>
<p>Some of the people had been killed with a shovel. Some had been killed with an axe. Some had been killed with a gun. Some had been strangled.</p>
<p>The 7 people who died had nothing in common. People who tried to find out who did it said that it must have been 7 different people who killed them. They said that they were probably a part of a gang. They said that a big gang like the <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">mafia</a> might have killed these people.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpacker_murders.html" title="Edit section: Catching Ivan Milat">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Catching Ivan Milat</span></h2>
<p>Ivan Milat was a man who lived near Belangalo State Forest. He tried to help police to find out what happened. Police said that he knew too much about the murders, so they thought maybe he had killed someone. So police started to spy on him to try to find out if he had killed people.</p>
<p>Ivan Milat had a big gun and he liked to go on long trips in a car by himself.</p>
<p>One man in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> said that he nearly got killed, and he said what the man called himself.</p>
<p>One day police looked in Ivan Milat's house, and they found a post card that said the same name that the man in England had said he had used.</p>
<p>Police then said that Ivan Milat must have tried to kill that man. They also said that meant that Ivan Milat must have killed all of the other people.</p>
<p>Ivan Milat went to court, and people in court said that Ivan Milat did kill all of these people.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/c/Backpacker_murders.html" title="Edit section: The mystery">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The mystery</span></h2>
<p>A man named <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chopper_Read_cf04.html" title="Chopper Read">Chopper Read</a> said that he knew who killed the people in the "backpacker murders". He said it was a big gang in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> that killed them.</p>
<p>Some people think that other people helped Ivan Milat. Some people said his brothers helped him, or a girl, or lots of other people.</p>
<p>Some people think that police said that Ivan Milat did it because they did not know who did it, or because they were too scared of the mafia.</p>
<p>Police have said that there are more than 30 people that went missing that might have been killed by Ivan Milat.</p>
