<p>Case closed. There is no other theory that does this. The definition of a theory is a framework model that has never been faslified, that describes all observations ever made, and has predictive power. The only cosmological model that does this is the Big Bang. I challenge the editor who is changing the restrictive article "the" to "a" to show how any other model accomplishes the criteria that make the Big Bang the scientific theory that describes the origin and evolution of the universe. --216.125.49.252 21:12, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For one thing, it's better style and grammar to start off with an indefinite article (a or an) for something that hasn't been mentioned yet, ie, the first mention of something, and the definite article (the) only thereafter... There's nothing wrong or incorrect about saying it's "a" scientific theory - even if it really is the only one, which I doubt. I don't like to give the impression that it's the only possibility, because there is enough room for doubt that it is still called a "hypothesis" and nobody had their cam-corder on back then to be able to state with certainty how anything happened. Personally, I would want to see more of the actual reasons for myself to find it anywhere near convincing, since I am naturally skeptical of anyone who tells me to accept it on faith that they know what happened 36 billion years ago without giving any reasons I can understand. But I am comfortable with calling it "a" theory. I also don't like to give the impression that the entire scientific community world wide is "agreed" about anything so tangential, on any subject, since I know that is not the case - there are scientists in many countries, some are funded by differing political agendas, and the former Soviet scientists, for example, usually said quite different things from other countries' scientists. So calling it "the" theory seems a little presumptuous, you can rarely get a room full of scientist to agree on all the details of such a theory. Some may say 36 billion years ago, some may say 72 billion, or whatever, and nobody can say for sure or prove anything, because until the cam-corder shows up it will always be an unprovable theory (or set of theories.) Having said all that, my being a sysop has nothing to do with this, since I have no special authority in a content dispute, so I am reverting in my capacity as an editor, not as a sysop.

<p>The whole reasoning and logic behind the "theory" seems a little forced to me anyway... From the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"...which shows that the universe is getting bigger and colder. If the universe is getting bigger and colder, then it used to be smaller and hotter, so many scientists think that a long time ago, the universe was as small and hot as possible..."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Here we have a <b>premise</b> (that the universe is getting bigger and colder) and a <b>conclusion</b>. The reason given for the premise is "redshift", which is not further explained. Now even if we assume that this is a correct premise, the conclusion seems faulty, because it assumes things have been going in a constant direction temperature wise for 13 billion years or whatever, basically since the beginning of time. Which is completely unknowable. In my own observation nearly everything in nature and in the universe <i><b>fluctuates</b></i>; few things can be expected or assumed to go in the same direction for 13 billion years. It would be like arguing "The Earth is currently getting warmer. Therefore, scientists think that at one time it was as cold as possible". <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 15:10, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please, 71.57.90.3, be civil! Messages of that sort are not tolerated on Wikipedia. Try to be kind and tolerant. Assume good faith.<br />
Anyway, this point is going out to people arguing over this article; Wikipedia is not a scientific nor religious argument. We state the verifiable facts, and at the moment, everyone is well aware that the Big Bang is the current accepted theory by <i>the majority</i> of physicians and people in the world. If this changes, the article stays exactly as it is except for telling the reader that it is a rejected theory. No offence meant at all by this, but your personal opinion doesn't count for anything in this article. The only things that are important in this article: That it is presented as a <i>scientific theory</i>, not a fact; <i>all</i> of the theory is stated, even if it seems controversial to you; and the criticisms of the theory be presented to the reader. Presenting it as a scientific theory <i>does not mean</i> that you back up every single statement with "scientists guess" or "they think that" or "it is a theory that". It needs stating only once at the top that "the Big Bang is a scientific theory..." or something of that sort.<br />

<dd>I agree, but I am already too involved so I will have to recuse myself from doing anything like that... actually, with the qualification "that is accepted by almost all cosmologists" that now appears in the text, the "the" versus "a" doesn't make that much difference, so perhaps I shouldn't have reverted that last time... But I do get irked, when nobody can say with certainty exactly how the Universe was formed if they were not present to eye-witness it, then to make what is after all only a "theory" decided "behind closed doors" if you will, by a community that rejects all dissent, to sound so certain and indisputable. That is the definition of pov "pushing". For thousands of years, people have argued about how the Universe was formed, and most people have now learned to live with different ideas, but it seems intolerant to claim the authority to tell everyone else what they "must" believe about it, even without understanding why. That's why neutrality is so important. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 15:54, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wasn't getting carried away, I was simply reverting this user's version, as per Blockinblox's version. I am sorry for doing this, since it has seemed to have started an edit war over a three letter word, but I simply thought I was doing right and that I was saving work for other contributors. I am sorry for starting an edit war, however I can understand both points of view after what Archer7 has said. In this situation, I thought I was doing a good job by reverting your edits, but as Archer7 said, both versions make sense and it isn't worth an edit war.

<dd>Thanks Neto, but it's a little belated - The principal opponents of the "the", (Billz and myself), have now already both conceded that we can live with the wording as it now stands, so I don't think there is going to be any more revert war here... But please note that a similar storm is brewing over at "<a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe.html" title="Universe">Universe</a>" with the same anon, over more than just a couple letters - it seems he doesn't like it being said that no one knows for sure how it began, because of course he feels he <i>does</i> know for sure, and he wants all readers to share in his confidence. His comparison with the French Revolution is totally illogical, since we do have plenty of eyewitness accounts to corroborate at least on that one...! <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 01:00, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
