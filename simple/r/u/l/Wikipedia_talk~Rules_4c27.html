If anyone demands this kind of attention on the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Wikipedia_f17d.html" title="Simple English Wikipedia">Simple English Wikipedia</a>, we should certainly ban him, or harass him off.

<dd>We are not aiming to harass anyone off anywhere. That attitude is not appropriate. Please just focus on the articles rather than using this as a place to worry about issues that may or may not be affecting the English Wikipedia.

<dd>I think what is "not appropriate" is that some deeply damaged or paid-to-provoke people will exploit the stupidity or tolerance of others to literally destroy the project and ruin everyone's hard work. If a few rude words here and there can get rid of those who make that their goal, well, I intend to do what is required, and to hell with any GodKing who "doesn't get it". It's not as if trying to work within a process is worth my time, given how many people have been abused trying to do so. Like poor Martin who tried to follow procedures again and again for months, being constantly and deliberately undermined and sabotaged - that just isn't going to be allowed to happen here. Any rules we have had better be strict, fair, and really followed, and have nothing to do with "community", only "content" and keeping those who contribute it, coming back. Not driving them away by giving obviously biased idiots second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh chances. While driving away literally dozens of fully qualified scholars who cite their sources when necessary, and can tell what's obvious from what isn't.</dd>

<p>Things seem to be a bit different over here than at en:, probably because there are no policies yet. I assume contributors should stick to en: policy where applicable but I'm not sure it all applies.</p>

<dd>Much of it clearly does not.</dd>

<dd>For one, en: have Wiktionary to put dictionary definitions into. There is not (as yet) a Simple English equivalent to that. Many of the articles currently at Simple would be removed from en: for being 'mere dictionary definitions', but I think this is one area Simple needs its own policy on. I personally feel that dictionary definitions are very helpful if people are going to use Simple as a base for translation. It also solves the problems of using difficult words where you can't avoid it as you can link to an explanation of that word on a separate page. So, are there any objections to allowing such articles to appear here? <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a>, August, very early, UTC.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No objections here. It would be technically easy to set up a simple dictionary and link to there from simple articles. Though WP may not be a dictionary, in keeping with the name and spirit of this project, why not keep everything in one place? It's simpler that way. 8) CyberMaus 15:02, 7 October 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm surprised there are no policies regarding proper discussion on Simple Wiki. How do I propose that these policies from English Wiki become policies here? The two policies I am talking about are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:CIVIL" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:CIVIL" rel="nofollow">civility</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks" rel="nofollow">No Personal Attacks</a>. Also, I think the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" rel="nofollow">"Assume Good Faith"</a> guideline should maybe become a guidline here (is there a place for guidelines?). If anyone needs me to explain what these mean I can give you a simplified version of the basic idea of these policies and guidelines (and if you want I can describe the difference between policy and guideline). Perhaps the title should be changed to make them more simple. "Civility" should be changed to "Politeness", "No Personal Attacks" to "No Insults". I can't think of another name for "Assume Good Faith" now, but it should be changed too. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 05:15, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I generally try to operate under the assumption that Simple operates under the same policies and guidelines as EN, unless otherwise stated, to keep from having us spend a lot of time duplicating all that material here. Unless they've really cleaned up AfD, the comments there make it clear that having written policies regarding behavior in discussions doesn't actually stop uncivil, etc. comments. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 18:09, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not against Netoholic's move from "Policies and guidelines to Rules (since, as he says, rules is a much simpler word). I am also not upset by his incorporation of the "English Wikipedia policy application" policy directly into this page, followed by a delete of the policy, which I originally proposed based on comments here. However, I do think that a few of the changes made during the rewrite should be changed back:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it is helpful and important to add a visible note that <a href="../../../c/o/r/Wikipedia%7ECore_article_258a.html" title="Wikipedia:Core article">Wikipedia:Core article</a> is a <i>temporary</i> guideline, which will be removed when the core articles are complete, as we discussed and agreed when planning its creation. This is all the more important because that removal may be soon.</li>
<li>Additionally, I think it is useful (though perhaps not vital) to mention in the list that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> is a disputed policy in its current form.
