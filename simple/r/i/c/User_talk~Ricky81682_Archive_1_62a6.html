<p>I understand your frustration, completely. I suppose I'll ask you to be patient and see if your recent message about spelling hits home. She does seem to require frequent "reminders", but seems to quietly take advice. If if gets to the point that you do have to monitor her contributions too closely, I would encourage you to bring it up on Simple talk. Perhaps a public "hearing" would help. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 01:23, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Looking in on some of your edits (cuz I know nothing about these category and interwiki things) I saw a strange thing on page [[Category:2002]]. Where on some other pages there is an '*', on this page it says '2' in bold, under the "There is 1 article..." and above the link to '2002'. Do you see that when you display the page? I've tried a couple different browsers (IE,Opera,Firefox - all show the same thing) because I can't 'see' anything different between the page text for 2002 and others. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Basically, I've been playing this by ear. It is technically against the GFDL to copy articles here without their page history. Most often, (well-meaning or otherwise...) people will copy articles directly here. Sometimes, this is done to preserve their POV (because the en: article is being edit warred). Other times, I've deleted articles copied by IP addresses which haven't made any edits since then. Occasionally, an article make sense here, and I copy the editor history, then clean it up or mark it with {{simp}}. Obviously, it is unfair (and illegal) for articles to just be copied directly. Let me know if you disagree. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 01:45, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
I agree with you that cats like <a href="../../../1/9/7/Category%7E1972_deaths.html" title="Category:1972 deaths">Category:1972 deaths</a> could all fit into <a href="../../../2/0/t/Category%7E20th_century_deaths.html" title="Category:20th century deaths">Category:20th century deaths</a>, but I'm also thinking about the fact that there could be articles created where the year of death is not exact but we know it was in the 1970s. There, the <a href="../../../1/9/7/Category%7E1970s_deaths.html" title="Category:1970s deaths">Category:1970s deaths</a> cat fits in. For the 20th century, it's probably not an issue but I know that there's some vagueness in earlier centuries. Also, I don't think that 100 subcategories in the 20th century deaths would particularly easy to navigate, especially if we start to have articles with unclear dates. However, I find that's more likely to be a problem with birth years. Besides, this is how English is organized and I think they've probably dealt with more issues than we have. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 18:46, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In this case, I think that EN:'s system is also not ideal. Also, the word "century" isn't a very simple term (it's not in <a href="../../../b/e/_/BE_1500_3318.html" title="BE 1500">Basic English</a>, though it is in <a href="../../../v/o/a/Wikipedia%7EVOA_Special_English_Word_Book_4395.html" title="Wikipedia:VOA Special English Word Book">Special English</a>) and the "20th century" being the name for the 1900s isn't a common concept in all languages. I'd actually prefer our categories be like Category:1900-1999 deaths or Category:Births (1900-1999). Really, we won't have too many "vague" dates, and I would be hesitant to categorize any articles in any death category if we don't know the year precisely. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 20:20, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Just a question. What is the point of these birth and death categories that you keep inserting. Surely if somebody wanted to know the year, they would just go to the year page and look under eith births or deaths? It seems like duplicate information and a waste of space to me, but am open to hearing the argument. Maya 11:43, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Umm, good that there is the exception for vandalism, otherwise I was also thinking a short ban would be worth it. Fortunately they paused long enough for reinforcements to arrive.</p>
<p>Have you considered adminship again? While I'm a couple hours 'older', you've done much more here, and have certainly exceeded the "1000 edit level" (by going on 180% over). While it was comforting for <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">User:Netoholic</a> to note that I could have hurried over to his English talk page to get his attention, I'm still feeling a bit insecure. Hmm, says that <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">User:Angela</a> was <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Elections_for_the_Board_of_Trustees_of_the_Wikimedia_Foundation%2C_2005" class="extiw" title="meta:Elections_for_the_Board_of_Trustees_of_the_Wikimedia_Foundation,_2005">re-elected</a> to board of Trustees, so I guess she won't necessarily have <i>less</i> time to look in on things.

<p>Hi Ricky. You <i>do</i> realize that I started here all of a week after you did?&#160;;) Though admittedly did only a few things initially. But then, as has been readily demonstrated to me recently, this is <i>way</i> more about a popularity thing than otherwise. For example, 65.31.115.145 thinks I am an <i>ultra-bad meanie face</i> as I commented that he was not npov when he changed the definition of sexual orientation to be only about sex rather than sex <b>and</b> affectional preference. See <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexuality</a>.</p>
<p>Right. &lt;rolls eyes&gt;</p>
<p>So given that most of the vostes that are actually there (excepting yours) are about whethere the person <i>likes</i> me, you may as well assume that I am not further interested. Evidence of something being a popularity contest is like the proverbial red rag to the bull to me.&#160;;) Though I will continue to do what I actually enjoy though. -<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 15:41, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not an techy but as I understand it there are ways of deleting a page. One way puts a block on it being created in future.

<p>He's out of control. The latest is that if I can't cite proof positive (I guess by way of a survey of every single biologist, epidemiologist, and provider on the planet) he's going to keep reverting to his 'qualified' nonsense. Sorry, but what O'Riley and Coulter say about the efficacy of sex education is not what is in the peer-reviewed medical literature. He's asked for sources, he got that. Hell, I even looked up that Vatican's web address for him.</p>
<p>Now (having cited nothing supporting his POV) he's making some argument that despite citing sources, the following statement is NPOV: “<a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientist.html" title="Scientist">Scientists</a> who study (look at and learn about) people who use condoms, see that if teenagers (children 13-19) learn about condoms (and other <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_control.html" title="Birth control">birth control</a>) they have <i>less</i> unsafe sex. Scientists see that learning about these things does not make teenagers start having sex earlier.”</p>
<p>I even agreed to the statement that kids given real sex ed don't have sex earlier instead of that they actually have sex later. If you look at the entirety of the literature as a whole, it pretty much says the effect is there (there are positive and neutral studies but no negative ones.) However, getting into an argument about why the neutral studies represent a type II error just isn't worth it.</p>
<p>However, the 'prove that Santa doesn't exist, or you must accept that he does' nonsense is way off. I am willing to accept reasonable changes (and to be honest, he's actually contributed some decent changes.) However, I do not think he's in this to improve the article. He's in this to <i>discredit</i> the article, as evidenced by the suggestion that it was not NPOV because I didn't cite a source that the Vatican is anti-birth control. Its nonsense and goes beyond 'good faith.'</p>
<p>Though I will admit the sock thing is kind of funny:</p>
<ul>
<li>He creates a sock to support his views in Talk:AIDS.</li>
<li>I call the sock a sock (with a nice illustration.)</li>
<li>He replies that he <i>didn't upload that picture</i> and does some other edits.</li>
<li>Then I <i>explain</i> to him what a sock is.</li>
<li>Then BallSack leaves for a while and Mr sock returns (duly outraged, moments later), objects, and does a few posts to prove he's <i>not a sock, dammit!</i></li>
<li>Then after a few posts proving he's not a sock, Mr sock stops, and within minutes BallSack is posting again.</li>
<li>Then I point out that he's being obvious with the timing of his posts going B, B, B, B, S, S, S, S, B, B, B, B.</li>
<li>Then immediately BallSack and Mr Sock begin posting nearly simultaneously, to prove that they are two different people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Me, I would have given up on the sockpuppet by that point. But then I'm not still in the last throes of my adolescence.</p>
<p>Though if it helps in your addressing this, I will be humping ass in my clinic for the next two days – 10 hrs each day, a 2 hour commute, and I have to do some goofy 1-2 hour interview thing about the clinic (tranny doc treats tranny patients, news at 11, something dumb like that) in addition to the time I'm driving and working.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry to drop this in your lap, but from my short time here you seem the most level-headed of the 'main players'...</p>
<p>I'm not going to contribute to this wiki, and I'm going to actively discourage others from doing so because of the actions of Netoholic. Because I failed to put the source/copyright of images I uploaded (my mistake, I realise), not only were the images deleted (no problem, I could put them back easily), but also the articles I had written as well. The warning was given in the same minute as the first image was deleted, the articles deleted within 5 minutes:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Deletion log); 04:34 . . Netoholic (Talk) (deleted "Image:Matsoro Xiao.jpg": no source, not on en:)</li>
<li>(Deletion log); 04:34 . . Netoholic (Talk) (deleted "Tchen Hong": not on en:)</li>
<li>(Deletion log); 04:34 . . Netoholic (Talk) (deleted "Hitami Yakima": not on en:)</li>
<li>(Deletion log); 04:33 . . Netoholic (Talk) (deleted "Image:Hitami Yakima.JPG": no source, not on en)</li>
<li>(Deletion log); 04:31 . . Netoholic (Talk) (deleted "Image:Tchen Hong 2005.jpg": no source)</li>
<li>(diff) (hist) . . N User talk:HentaiFan; 04:31 . . Netoholic (Talk)</li>
</ul>
<p>If I had had time to see the <a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHentaiFan_c759.html" title="User talk:HentaiFan">message from Netoholic</a>, I would have gladly provided the information about the images, which I own copyright on (see <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html#Deletion_of_Images.2FArticles" title="User talk:Netoholic">my response to Netoholic</a>. Even if the images were deleted, it would be no great hardship to re-upload them. But to have the articles deleted too is both insulting and intimidating. I'm not prepared to spend my free time working for a community that will destroy all my work because I failed to cross a 't' or dot an 'i'.</p>
<p>If you can do something with Netoholic, then please do. He/She/It is ruining this wiki, and I'm pretty sure I'm neither the first, nor the last, who is leaving this wiki after a short space of time, and with sadness, because of Netoholic.</p>

<p>Thanks and no problem--I was glad when I checked RC and saw you'd gotten the email. I've found that when it's sustained like that, trying to revert it all before an admin can block them tends to just egg them on, so I after sending the emails I just went about my business until you showed up (and it seemed plenty prompt to me). I've been thinking of requesting to be an admin, mostly for cases like this (altho it would be nice to be able to fix cut&amp;paste moves, etc. myself), but I'd want to still just add speedy tags on articles that I wasn't sure qualified, to let someone with more experience here like you or Netoholic decide whether they should actually be deleted. Does that seem reasonable, or would it just feel like I was creating more work for you guys, that I had the power to take care of myself?

<p>I'm glad to see you back. Thank you for your message about that list. Sometimes, I have to do something else and forget to finish what I was doing here.</p>
<p>I marked List of coins for deletion because it is not much useful. It is unordered, lists old and modern coins together, and does not say anything about some of those coins.

<p>Hey Ricky81682,</p>
<p>How is the editing coming on the association football clubs? I'm asking because it is still on the RfD page, and I'm one who would like to get it off there. I guess now that <i>some</i> action is being taken, you could probably just move it straight to the log.
