<dd><b>Keep</b>. Whether it is a core article or not has nothing to do with whether it should be deleted. Having extra articles is not a bad thing. It isn't as if someone is going to get lost in the extra articles and not be able to find the information they want (the categories of which are prominently displayed on the main page). If someone wants to use their time on something that *you* think is a waste, let them, that's their right. I agree that this article is a very short stub, and a complicated (not simple) one. Neither one of those things is enough to make an article a candidate for deletion in my opinion (since each is something fixable), and whether or not this is a relevant article is immaterial. If it gets deleted, it won't bother me too much, but I don't think it deserves to be axed, just because it isn't one of the "top 1000." --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 20:42, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Weak <b>delete</b>. I pretty much agree with everything Cromwellt said, except for saying such entries 'do no harm'. The most effective way to teach/lead is by example. If a newcomer to the site sees <a href="../../../w/e/b/Category%7EWebsites_284d.html" title="Category:Websites">Category:websites</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/n/Category%7ENintendo_243e.html" title="Category:Nintendo">Category:Nintendo</a>, versus <a href="../../../p/r/i/Category%7EPrimates_5ff5.html" title="Category:Primates">Category:primates</a> (which itself is only a day or two old, but now exists thanks to user:aflm) I think they will be very misinformed about what we're trying to do here. Thus I am fairly supportive of efforts to try and correct that imbalance and confusion. Also, community repudiation of entries like this would, for example, support my efforts to keep <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_Forums_a7ce.html" title="Something Awful Forums">Something Awful Forums</a> a redir to <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a>, despite repeated attempts to create the SAF article. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 23:37, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I agree (certainly as far as categories are concerned) that having many very specific categories and very few general ones would give readers an unbalanced view. However, I think that as long as we have a good variety which includes many general categories (and this goes for articles, too; I'm talking about a much smaller ratio than 1000:1, like maybe 5:1 or 10:1), that websites and Nintendo are good and even useful categories to have, as long as we have content to go in them (which is always available from English Wikipedia for simplification). We're pretty much on the same page (so to speak) on this one, Freshstart. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 23:20, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

It is basically empty, and Simple English Wiktionary has taken over its function. Though there is a nomination to lock the SEWiktionary, it is active and see my <a href="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/user:Cromwellt" class="extiw" title="wikt:user:Cromwellt">user page</a> there for my personal vision/reasons why I think it should continue. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwell_4368.html" title="User:Cromwell">Cromwell</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwell_7089.html" title="User talk:Cromwell">Talk</a> 14:22, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, at least from what I see at the moment at Simple Wiktionary--the entries don't indicate whether they're BE <i>nnn</i>, or VOA, or whatever, and I think having a merged list of all those type of lists, especially <i>with definitions</i> (many BE/VOA words have many different meanings, and it is not always obvious which meaning Ogden or whoever had in mind) would be a good thing, and not the purpose of Simple Wiktionary. I see Simple Wiktionary as a tool for readers to look up words, and <a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia%7ESimple_English_Dictionary_8dff.html" title="Wikipedia:Simple English Dictionary">Wikipedia:Simple English Dictionary</a> as a very valuable resource for <i>editors</i> (at least potentially--right now it doesn't have enough entries to be very helpful, but all wikimedia-related projects started at zero at the beginning) here at Simple Wikipedia (after all it is in the Wikipedia: namespace). As for links, I have always been for as much interconnection between all the sister projects as possible, and would lean towards providing links to both EN Wiktionary AND Simple Wiktionary if they both have entries for the word, and let the reader pick which one they want to check; they might even like to see both. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 10:07, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I see this also as (if really necessary) a future section on SEWikt or perhaps an identification on each entry there. That way we follow precedent and logic, avoiding the inclusion here of dictionary entries, part of what <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> last time I checked. As the talk page for that article shows, there is far from a concensus on changing the policy which excludes dictionary entries, so until there is it should stay that way. I admit there has been some support for the idea of including articles on words with simple explanations, but these comments did not take into account the existence of SEWikt as a useful entity because at the time of the comments it was not. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 23:20, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

Plus the text is very complicated, not simple at all.

<li>Personally, I think that Simple should keep articles that could be useful at some point. For example, if we targeted this project more towards schools and perhaps those with learning difficulties that article could be useful. However, if we <i>are</i> scrapping all the articles that aren't core subjects, delete <a href="../../../t/e/l/Category%7ETelevision_series_5da9.html" title="Category:Television series">Category:Television series</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">Archer7</a> 22:05, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I find it interesting that we have articles about so many TV series, yet still do not have a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_series.html" title="Television series">Television series</a> article. This is a prime example of the failure of this project to have clear direction. It has <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Everybody_Loves_Raymond_1386.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Everybody Loves Raymond">nothing linking to it</a> and is readily covered on the main Wikipedias that cover the region it is important to. Does this article hold any value to someone in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>? Is it taught about in any school? Simple does not need to cover all subjects, and we do not need to be held to the rules of the main Wikipedias. Let's make a high-quality encyclopedia geared towards students of English and as an aid to translators who are creating other Wikipedias in their native language. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 04:13, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I couldn't agree more about this project lacking direction, and I suppose you're right about that kind of article. I think if we continued to remove articles like this we would lose about 2000 articles, which perhaps wouldn't be such a bad thing. Maybe the community needs to discuss where this project is going, so everyone has a clear view. Articles wildly vary in simplification, so people don't know what to expect from an article here, we need more guidelines for articles. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">Archer7</a> 10:56, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Same song, second verse. Deleting articles because they are not "core" articles is not useful. I have no great burden to have an "Everybody Loves Raymond" article on this wikipedia (nor will I feel lugubrious if/when it is deleted), but it should stay out of principle. Limiting what articles we <i>allow</i> is much too restrictive on the editors. Even using words like "allow" shows the overrestrictive nature of the idea. We are not a private club, no, not even here on Simple English Wikipedia. That is what "open-source" means. Whatever happened to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" class="extiw" title="w:en:Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith">assume good faith</a>, etc.? If editors want to make an article and it isn't vandalism or propaganda, etc., it certainly does no harm. As far as the "television series" article, if there were one, it would not bother me, but if I were writing it, I would put it as a section under <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> until there was enough material to be worth a separate article (if that ever happened). That would also be following precedent. Giving a project direction is one thing. Things like "Collaboration of the Week" and "Translation of the Week" do that. Forcing people to do something (or not do something) is another. As a suggestion, editors who feel strongly about having core articles perhaps should spend more time writing core articles and less time requesting that valid "non-core" articles be deleted. Note: I do not intend this vote/comment as a personal attack nor am I trying to offend anyone. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 16:57, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To be honest, I'm not sure. I agree with Cromwellt, but I'd also like to see much more of a focus on the core articles, until we get going. We need a big discussion to see where we should go with this project. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">Archer7</a> 17:02, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would love to be a part of such a discussion. And I have no problem with a focus on core articles. I even am interested in writing some of them myself. I feel that our preferences are not mutually exclusive if we are willing to be fair and act in good faith. As a preliminary proposition, how about we make notices in prominent places like the Community portal that say that <b>as we are still starting</b> or <b>until we grow</b> we encourage a focus on <a href="../../../c/o/r/Wikipedia%7ECore_article_258a.html" title="Wikipedia:Core article">core articles</a>. But it is important a)that this is stated as (and really is) <i>temporary</i>, b) that this is stated as (and really is) <i>encouragement</i>, not <i>requirement</i>, c) that people are not prohibited from working on/creating other valid but non-core articles, and d) that deletion of valid but non-core articles stops. If it is truly non-notable (not just "non-notable for SEWikipedia", because that is just another way of saying "non-core"), or almost any other reason except "non-core", deletion of articles is a valid and important process (which should generally be democratic as a reflection of consensus). As an expression of good faith, I volunteer to write the article on what a core article is, and I will include a statement of encouragement as above. I will also make a page on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProject_direction_b3a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Project direction">project direction</a> where we can talk about all of this. How does that sound? Let's work out a compromise if at all possible. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 16:35, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. There are several of our TV series articles that are less notable than Raymond, but I don't think we want to spend the time to deliberate the various merits of articles within the set. In principle, it probably would have been better if none of them had been created, but the project seems more focused now, so as a practical matter I don't want us bogged down in mitigating past problems. I also think there are video/computer games we have that are even less notable than any of the TV series; then there's the pop-singer-du-jours, etc. If we do want such holistic discussions, I'd start lower. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 06:56, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't see the current harm (it is valuable information, even if it isn't a core article), and I see future usefulness. It is actually copied from <a href="../../../../en/l/i/s/List_of_modern_weapons_by_type.html" class="extiw" title="en:List_of_modern_weapons_by_type">List of modern weapons by type</a>, rather than where it links. There are minor differences, but that could be because of an update to the English page or minor simplification. Either way, the article/list could still use some simplification/explanation, but that's not a reason for a delete, it's a reason for simplification. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 21:11, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. We don't have to accept an article just because English Wikipedia does. While she may be more notable than other articles we've kept, a self-promoting vanity article is still a self-promoting vanity article. If it does get deleted (we seem to be somewhat divided on this at the moment), and someone else rewrites the article (not she herself), I will not try to delete it again. But when it is written by the subject, that's vanity, period. See: <a href="../../../../en/v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html" class="extiw" title="en:Wikipedia:Vanity">vanity</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> (by subject). For what it's worth, I generally agree with the Wikipedia guidelines on vanity pages and autobiographical edits. I've written dozens of articles and accomplished thousands of Wikipedia edits, and I've reverted plenty of vandalism and pounced on plenty of bonafide vanity pages. In this case though, my intent was not to have a vanity page, but to <i>translate</i> a page that already existed on the English wikipedia. I have helped out with other "Simple English" pages, at least one of which linked to an "<a href="../../../e/l/o/Elonka_Dunin_e23d.html" title="Elonka Dunin">Elonka Dunin</a>" page, so I created a minimal stub page here in as neutral a manner as I could manage. If anyone feels the information is not neutral, then by all means, feel free to change it, or challenge anything you want on the talk page, and I'll back up anything there. For further data on whether or not I'm "notable", I have plenty of references at my personal site, you're welcome to check them yourselves:<a href="http://www.elonka.com/elonkanews.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elonka.com/elonkanews.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 07:00, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: So far it looks like this will be a keep. I would like to mention that I have nothing against User:Elonka except that she wrote the page about herself. Nothing personal. If the had asked me on my talk page to write a page for her (particularly if she mentioned that she had a page on English Wikipedia which was kept after a delete nomination), I probably would have done it, and I wouldn't have nominated it for deletion if someone else had done it, either. I'd also like to thank her for being willing to talk about it, provide references, and not take the delete nomination personally. Oh, and if the page stays, I won't be upset. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cromwellt_f6b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cromwellt">contris</a> 03:17, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is the second time I am placing this renomination here, because it was previously deleted out-of-process by Netoholic. This page was kept amid a mixed reaction four months ago when I nominated it for deletion the first time. I am now renominating it for these five reasons: 1) I have copied all relevant information (including abbreviations, sources, and external links) to <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wikipedia%7EWord_list_abbreviations_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Word list abbreviations">Wikipedia:Word list abbreviations</a>, so there is nothing there of value which is not somewhere else more appropriate; 2) it has been four months since the previous nomination for deletion (plenty of time for things to change); 3) the <a href="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikt:Main_Page">Simple English Wiktionary</a> is well on its way and has taken over the functions of that page; 4) consensus states (see <a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia%7ESimple_talk_51fd.html#Project_direction" title="Wikipedia:Simple talk">Wikipedia:Simple talk#Project direction</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ESimple_English_Wikipedia_1fb2.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Simple English Wikipedia">Wikipedia talk:Simple English Wikipedia</a>) that we should link to the Simple English Wiktionary, which basically makes this list obsolete; and 5) the list has not grown or even been modified since 04:29, 23 December 2005 (not counting vandalism or the deletion tag addition and removal), not even during or after the previous discussion here on RfD. If someone who voted <i>keep</i> had started adding to the list, I could understand keeping it in the hopes that it might become useful someday, but since no one has, this shows that the page is not going anywhere, and it is useless in its current form. As mentioned earlier, it has also been superseded by Simple English Wiktionary. It was an idea that was started but never got very far, and then another idea took its place. I think we should put it out of its misery. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cromwellt_f6b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cromwellt">contris</a> 00:31, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: This nomination must go through due process and discussion before a final decision is made. It is inappropriate to delete this nomination request without said due process.

<dd>The main justification for it from Jimbo was to add extra RC/NP 'patrolling' to living people (IE those who can sue)--"With our ever-increasing prominence, it is becoming more and more likely that questionable, unsourced information may sneak into articles, despite all of our goodwill and vigilance. Flagging all articles pertaining to living people will mean that our editors can keep a closer watch on these articles, check new articles more closely as they are created, and help to avoid potential problems.".
