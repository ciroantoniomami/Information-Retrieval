<p><i><b>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</b></i> is a <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_person_shooter.html" title="First person shooter">first person shooter</a> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_game.html" title="Computer game">computer game</a> published by Activision and released on November 20, 2001. The single player game was <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game_developer.html" title="Video game developer">developed</a> by Gray Matter Interactive and Nerve Software developed its multiplayer mode. <a href="../../../i/d/_/Id_Software_9f51.html" title="Id Software">Id Software</a>, the creators of the original game entitled <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i>, oversaw the development of the game and were credited as executive producers.</p>
<p>There are many different versions of the game. The Collector's Edition comes in metal case and includes promotional materials. The Game of the Year Edition comes with the original Wolfenstein 3D and game demos. The Platinum Edition comes with <i>Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</i>, a stand-alone expansion, and Wolfenstein 3D.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, the game was ported to the <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_2_dbfa.html" title="PlayStation 2">PlayStation 2</a> and <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox.html" title="Xbox">Xbox</a> video game consoles and subtitled as <i><b>Operation Resurrection</b></i> and <i><b>Tides of War</b></i>, respectively. Both console versions include a series of prequel single player missions where the main character, William Joseph "BJ" Blazkowicz (Agent Two) and his partner Agent One operate in Nazi-occupied <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> / <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Africa_6a9e.html" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>. The two player co-op mode is exclusive to consoles and allows the second player to play as Agent One (later tortured to death in the Wolfenstein castle/prison of Mission 1). The Xbox version has the addition of online play via Xbox Live.</p>
<p>The game is powered by a heavily-modified version of the Quake III engine. The Return to Castle Wolfenstein engine was subsequently used as the foundation for <i>Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</i> (Splash Damage/Activision), "Trinity" (Gray Matter Interactive/Activision) (shown at E3 in 2004, but cancelled shortly after) and <i><a href="../../../c/a/l/Call_of_Duty_97d9.html" title="Call of Duty">Call of Duty</a></i> (Infinity Ward/Activision).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../r/e/t/Return_to_Castle_Wolfenstein_cf64.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p><i>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</i> is a remake of sorts of the early, seminal <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-person_shooter.html" title="First-person shooter">first-person shooter</a>, <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i>. However, with the advances in graphics technology and gameplay design since the original game, without the name and the occasional in-game references, it would be unrecognisable as a remake.</p>
<p>It features a story-based single player campaign (taking up many of the themes from the original game), as well as a team-based networked multiplayer version which features different character classes that must work together in order to win, similar to the concept of Team Fortress. Although there are only four classes - lieutenant, medic, engineer, and soldier - the soldier can be one of several subclasses depending upon the special/heavy weapon that he selects. Some unique weapons not found in other WWII-themed first-person shooters include the flamethrower and the airstrike beacon. The multiplayer demo included a beachhead assault similar to the opening of the movie <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>.</p>
<p>The game is based on Castle Wewelsburg, a 17th century castle occupied by the Germans under Heinrich Himmler's control, and used for occult rituals and practices. Unlike the original <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i>, only a handful of the single player missions in <i>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</i> takes place in the infamous castle/prison. The single player game takes place in <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a>-occupied <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> during <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> and revolves around Allied Commando B.J. Blazkowicz, who, along with another agent (Agent One in the Xbox and PS2 versions), is sent to investigate rumors surrounding one of <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_Himmler_4919.html" title="Heinrich Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>'s personal projects, the SS Paranormal Division. The agents are, however, captured before completing their mission and are imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein. Taking the role of Blazkowicz, the player must escape the castle and continue investigating the activities of the SS Paranormal Division, which include research on resurrecting corpses, bio-technology, and secret weapons. During the game the player will face numerous foes, including Wehrmacht soldiers, elite <i>Fallschirmjäger</i> (paratroopers), legions of undead creatures, and horrific <i>Übersoldaten</i> (supersoldiers) formed from a hideous blend of surgery and chemical engineering. The end boss is an undead <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxon_people.html" title="Saxon people">Saxon</a> warrior-prince named Heinrich I. Some of the missions involving the undead were influenced by <i>The Mummy</i> (1999) and <i>The Mummy Returns</i> (2001) movies, and somewhat similar to <i><a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_Jones_9930.html" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a></i>. Other missions are similar to romanticized fictional stories of Allied commandos and resistance fighters that operated behind enemy lines to spy and sabotage.</p>
<p>To make the game eligible for sale in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, the developers of the game removed the infamous Nazi swastika in <i>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</i>. In its stead, the German forces' logo is a creative logo that can be interpreted in 3 different ways; <i>Quake III Arena</i> (a game previously developed by id Software and the graphics engine that <i>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</i> is based upon), an Eagle (a symbol often used to represent Germany), and "W" (standing for Wolfenstein). Every reference to the "Third Reich" was removed; thus, the player is not battling Nazis, but a secret sect called the "Wolves" led by Heinrich Höller, whose name is a pun of the original character Himmler (Himmler roughly translates as "<i>Heaven</i>er", Höller as "<i>Hell</i>er").</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Mission 1: Ominous Rumors:</b> While investigating the activities of the SS Paranormal Division in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, B.J. Blazkowicz and Agent One are captured by the Nazis. Agent One dies whilst being interrogated by a Nazi <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">torturer</a>, but B.J. manages to kill the soldier guarding his cell and escapes Castle Wolfenstein's dungeons. Armed only with a Luger and a knife, he has to find a way out of the castle, fighting through platoons of guards, and ultimately using a tram car to leave the area and meet up with a member of the German resistance in a nearby village.</li>
<li><b>Mission 2: Dark Secret:</b> The SS Paranormal Division under Oberführer Helga von Bulow has been excavating the catacombs and crypts of an ancient church within the village. Their sloppy precautions have led to the awakening of hordes of undead creatures, including <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zombies.html" title="Zombies">zombies</a> and skeletal <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxon_people.html" title="Saxon people">Saxon</a> <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">knights</a>. B.J. descends into the crypts where he finds isolated German soldiers fighting the undead. Blazkowicz himself destroys many of these creatures and eventually arrives in an ancient defiled church, where a Nazi research chemist, Professor Zemph, is conducting an experiment on an ancient corpse. Blazkowicz fights Helga's personal "Elite Guard", comprised of female soldiers, and finally encounters a hideous beast which has killed Helga (Zemph was executed for trying to back out on the plot). After slaying the creature, Blazkowicz is extracted on an Allied <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomber.html" title="Bomber">bomber</a> plane.</li>
<li><b>Mission 3: Weapons of Vengeance:</b> One of Germany's leading scientific researchers and Head of the SS "Special Projects Division", Wilhelm Strasse, (known as "Deathshead"), has prepared to launch an attack on <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> using a V-2 rocket fitted with an experimental chemical warhead. Blazkowicz is parachuted some distance from the missile base and smuggles himself into the base in a supply lorry. Inside the base, Blazkowicz destroys the V-2 rocket on its launchpad and fights his way out of the facility towards an airbase filled with experimental jet aircraft. After fighting his way through the airbase, he commandeers a "Kobra" rocket-plane and flies to safety in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a>.</li>
<li><b>Mission 4: Deadly Designs:</b> Eager to know more about Deathshead and his secret projects, the OSA sends Blazkowicz to the bombed city of Kugelstadt, where he is assisted by members of the German resistance in breaking in to a ruined factory. There he discovers the blueprints for the Reich's latest weapon, an extremely high-tech small arm called a "Venom Gun", capable of inflicting appalling casualties on Allied forces. Blazkowicz eventually breaks into Deathshead's underground research complex, the Secret Weapons Facility (SWF). There he encounters horrific creatures, malformed and twisted through <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgery</a> and mechanical implants, which are revealed to be prototypes for the Strasse's "Übersoldat" programme. Blazkowicz sees Deathshead escape the SWF by U-Boat, and learns of its destination by interrogating a captured German officer. He is later extracted by unknown means.</li>
<li><b>Mission 5: Deathshead's Playground:</b> Blazkowicz is parachuted into <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a>, close to the revealed location of Deathshead's mysterious "X-Labs". After breaking into the X-Labs, he sees several of the twisted creatures he encountered in Kugelstadt break out of their protective cages and turn on the laboratory's staff. Fighting his way through the facility, Blazkowicz retrieves Deathshead's journals and confronts several prototype <i>Übersoldaten</i>, towering monstrosities coated in armour, powered by <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydraulic.html" title="Hydraulic">hydraulic</a> legs, and carrying powerful fixed weapons. Finally, he confronts and destroys one of Deathshead's ultimate <i>Übersoldaten</i> and kills the researchers who had developed it. Deathshead himself escapes in a rocket-plane and Blazkowicz is again extracted by unknown means.</li>
<li><b>Mission 6: Return Engagement:</b> After studying the documents captured by Blazkowicz, the OSA has become aware of a scheme codenamed "Operation: Resurrection", a plan to resurrect the corpse of Heinrich I. Despite the skepticism of senior Allied commanders, the OSA parachutes Blazkowicz into the Harz mountains of Germany, close to Castle Wolfenstein itself. He arrives at the village of <a href="../../../p/a/d/Paderborn.html" title="Paderborn">Paderborn</a> and, after assassinating several senior officers of the SS Paranormal Division, fights his way into Chateau Schutzstaffel, where he encounters members of the Elite Guard. Blazkowicz then fights his way through the grounds of the chateau, facing opposition from members of the Elite Guard and three of Deathshead's <i>Übersoldaten</i>. Having destroyed the mechanical soldiers, Blazkowicz enters an excavation site near Castle Wolfenstein.</li>
<li><b>Mission 7: Operation Resurrection:</b> Inside the excavation site, Blazkowicz fights Nazi guards and prototype <i>übersoldaten</i>, and makes his way to a boarded-up entrance to Castle Wolfenstein's crypts. There, he finds that the castle has become infested by undead creatures, which are attacking the castle's desperate garrison. After fighting his way through the castle, Blazkowicz arrives at the site of a dark ceremony to resurrect Heinrich I. At the ceremony, SS Psychic Marianna Blavatsky conjures up dark spirits, which transform three <i>Übersoldaten</i> into Dark Knights, Heinrich's lieutenants. She ultimately raises Heinrich I, who "thanks" her by stealing her soul and turning her into his undead slave. In a climactic battle, Blazkowicz destroys the three Dark Knights and Heinrich I as SS chief <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_Himmler_4919.html" title="Heinrich Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> watches in horror from afar.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../r/e/t/Return_to_Castle_Wolfenstein_cf64.html" title="Edit section: Weapons">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Weapons</span></h2>
<p>Upon starting the game, the player's only weapon is a <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knife.html" title="Knife">knife</a>, though almost immediately he obtains a Luger from a fallen guard. He can also use a kick simultaneously with any weapon, though the kick does minimal damage and is primarily useful for bashing open doors or inflicting property damage.</p>
<p>The third weapon the player finds is an MP-40 German SMG, which uses the same 9mm ammunition as the Luger. Shortly thereafter, the player also obtains a scope-less Mauser rifle, which has high damage and accuracy, but uses a different 7,92 x 57 mm ammunition. A scoped Mauser is obtained later on.</p>
<p>In later levels the player receives a silenced Sten submachine gun, which uses the same ammunition as the MP-40 and Luger. He also receives a Thompson submachine gun and Colt .45 which are slightly more powerful than MP-40 and Luger, though with substantially rarer ammunition.</p>
<p>As the game progresses, the player also finds a flamethrower (though ammunition is somewhat rare), the Fallschirmjägergewehr Model 1942 paratrooper rifle (which uses the same ammunition as the Mauser), and several fictional weapons: a Tesla cannon and Venom Minigun. An experimental American silenced sniper rifle with infrared scope, called the Snooper Scope was also available (Although the real life equivalent did not have a silencer). All used unique ammunition.</p>
<p>The player also uses several varieties of explosives throughout the game, which include the Panzerfaust, <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamite.html" title="Dynamite">dynamite</a> and the "pineapple" and "potato masher" hand grenades of the Allies and Axis, respectively.</p>
<p>Several weapons have alternate modes of fire, which are activated by a key press. The Luger's alternate mode is a silencer (found in an early level), the Colt's alternate is dual-wielded Colts, and both the rifles's alternate mode is an adjustable telescopic zoom (neither scoped rifle has a visible crosshair in normal fire mode).</p>
<p>The Sten and Venom guns both have the capability of overheating. The spread of bullets will increase as the Sten is fired, seen also as an enlarging aiming circle. While firing, a bar appears onscreen which indicates the relative temperature of the weapon, which also decreases over time; upon reaching a specific threshold, the weapon ceases firing until the bar completely disappears.</p>

<p>A multiplayer-only spinoff of the series, <i>Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</i>, was originally planned as a full-fledged expansion pack for <i>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</i> developed by Splash Damage. The single player component of the game was never completed and thus was removed entirely. The developers at that point decided the multiplayer part would be released as a free, downloadable standalone game. <i>Enemy Territory</i> is a team-based networked multiplayer game which involves completing objectives through team-work and by using different character classes.</p>
<p>In 2005, id Software and Splash Damage announced a follow-up to <i>Enemy Territory</i> entitled <i>Enemy Territory: Quake Wars</i> using the Doom 3 engine. This new game will feature similar large-scale gameplay but instead of taking place in the Wolfenstein universe it will be a prequel to <i>Quake II</i> and <i>Quake 4</i>. <i>ET:QW</i> is speculated for release in early 2007.</p>

<p>In July 2004, <a href="../../../i/d/_/Id_Software_9f51.html" title="Id Software">id Software</a> CEO Todd Hollenshead briefly mentioned that a sequel to Wolfenstein was in development saying "Return to Castle Wolfenstein... basically the sequel to that is a project that's already under works at another studio". It has been confirmed that this statement was not referring to <i>Enemy Territory: Quake Wars</i>, which was the general assumption when ET:QW was announced. It is likely that it will be developed using Doom 3 technology. There have been a couple of news articles about RTCW2 discoveries, including an email received from Todd Hollenshead which can be viewed at <a href="http://www.rtcw2.com" class="external free" title="http://www.rtcw2.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.rtcw2.com</a>.</p>

<p>A Return to Castle Wolfenstein film was announced in 2002, however there has been little information since. On July 20 2005, IGN had an interview with ID Software about the Return to Castle Wolfenstein film.<a href="http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/635/635120p1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/635/635120p1.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> In the interview, Todd Hollenshead says that the movie is in the works, though isn't very far along yet.</p>
