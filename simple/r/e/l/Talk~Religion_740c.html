	    <p>Religion is best defined as an acronym: Reli-G-I-On meaning Rely God-Me On which says rely on the relationship between you and God. Thus it is incorrect to call Buddhism a religion when they are no more relying on a personal God than any other social or athletic club. Regarding the three major Satanic religions, Islam, Paganism, and Satanism itself, Religion is of course misleading because their god Satan is evil but since people rely on Satan as a god who has control of the earth except when and where people with faith in Jesus Christ interrupt Satan's power, it is possible to call their beliefs and practices dark religions.</p>
<p>There is an interesting correspondance between Islam and Paganism in the Islamic Allah and the Pagan Pan. Pan means All as in Pan-American. So both groups worship "All" which Buddhists do also without personalizing it as a deity. The All however includes all evil as well as good, it includes as explained above all things on earth under Satan's spiritual control except when the light of Christ claims ownership by being expressed over some person, place, or thing via the faith of a believing Christian.</p>
<p>With Religion accurately defined it should be possible to unify people in the true faith which is preferrable to mere tolerance. Unfortunately even within Christianity unification has been harder to accomplish than division. Thus we need to define the true faith for everyone to learn to participate in. The Gospel is Mt, Mk, Lk, Jn, and Rv which is the new pentateuch having most of the recorded words of Jesus Christ. The much shorter message of evangelism is only a first step toward understanding the Gospel and the much longer message of the New Testament has misled people into religions that in many ways do not practice what Jesus Christ did. So the gospel is the focus of truth which needs to be read, loved, believed, and prayed into current practice. We must learn to walk on water, heal the dead, and rule nature as Jesus did in order to follow him accurately. With all mankind cooperating toward that goal there should be no religious differences.</p>
<p>We must further that goal by redefining church or what groups of believers are. The true church is that church led solely by Jesus Christ which Christian believers participate in after death. The true church should be expressed here on earth. As is the common statement, you can't take it with you, so the true church has no material property or physical wealth -- its value is spiritual and its talents are the knowledge, skills, and abilities of Jesus Christ including the ability to walk on water, heal, and other miracles as needed. There can be no money in the true church which is the kingdom of prayer. Likewise there can be no positions of power, authority, and control.</p>

<p>"Religion is the term? for describing? a system? for? the worship? of any <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_being.html" title="Divine being">divine being</a>?, for example, God?." -- I think that this is not a very good definition of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>, because the idea of divine beings is not a basic idea in some religions, for example <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>.</p>
<p>I am drafting a version of this please let me know if anyone else is--<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a><a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">|talk</a> 20:42, 28 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have written many interesting things about the different world religions at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/tulsidas_ramayan" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/tulsidas_ramayan" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/tulsidas_ramayan</a> and I am now writing my first book at <a href="http://toosmallforsupernova.org" class="external free" title="http://toosmallforsupernova.org" rel="nofollow">http://toosmallforsupernova.org</a> - Sitaram</p>
<p>Allah is just the arabic word for God, it has nothing to do with the English word "all", just as Pan's name has nothing to do with the pan- prefix meaning all.</p>
<p>The Arabic word 'allah' shares a common root with the Hebrow word 'elohim', they both mean 'god'. I'm fairly certain the English word 'all' is derived from Old Norse, where the word is either 'all' or 'alle'. As for Pan and pan, even though they are both Greek, the words are unrelated homonyms like the two meanings of 'can'. And Kirk Fraser, if you're reading this, I suggest that you buy a good dictionary that lists the root words at least as far back as Latin, Greek, Norse and Hebrew. Until then you should be able to get by with dictionary.com.</p>

<dd>As an extra note, Pan refers to the god of nature. Pantheism is the idea that God is made manifest in nature. Thanks for your "copyrighted" contribution, KIRK-DURRRRRRRK, very funny.</dd>

<dd>Which isn't really relevent since, although pantheism has existed as a concept for thousands of years, the term itself was coined by John Toland during the Rennaissance, who clearly used 'pan' to mean 'all' and not 'Greek deity of shepherds, livestock and nature'.</dd>
