<p>During the early <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, the popularity of rhythm and blues music spread. It became very popular among young white people. They listened to this music on radio stations that broadcast across the country late at night. Some teenagers began buying rhythm and blues records as a form of rebellion.</p>
<p>This music was very different from the music that was popular with their parents. The music was exciting, and it had a very strong rhythm and beat. Some of the songs had words which suggested <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual</a> themes. In other cases, the singers made sexually suggestive gestures or movements while they were singing. Some adults strongly objected to rhythm and blues music. They did not think young people should listen to it.</p>
<p>Alan Freed had a radio show in <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland%2C_Ohio_cd1a.html" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a> in the early 1950s. He is said to be the first person to use the expression "rock and roll" to describe rhythm and blues music. Alan Freed was one of the first to play rock and roll music on his radio show, and he organized the first rock and roll concert in Cleveland in 1952.</p>
<p>Songs by black performers like Fats Domino and Little Richard soon became popular with teenagers. These singers recorded their records in the southern city of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana_f945.html" title="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>.</p>
<p>Some early Rock and Roll music was created in the southern United States city of Memphis, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee.html" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>. In Memphis, a white record producer called Sam Phillips produced records by local black musicians. One day, an eighteen-year-old truck driver came to his studio to record a song for his mother. The young man was <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>. Phillips produced Presley's first real record in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>, a song called "That's All Right."</p>
<p>Bill Haley and his Comets recorded "Rock Around the Clock" in 1954. It was not popular at first. Then it was used in a movie about rebellious teenagers, called "The Blackboard Jungle". The movie caused a lot of debate. It also made the song a huge hit. "Rock Around the Clock" became a song of teenage rebellion.</p>
<p>Many other rock and roll singers became popular in the 1950s. They included <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Holly_7119.html" title="Buddy Holly">Buddy Holly</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Lee_Lewis_0199.html" title="Jerry Lee Lewis">Jerry Lee Lewis</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Berry_39cc.html" title="Chuck Berry">Chuck Berry</a>. Each performer created his own kind of rock and roll. Chuck Berry's music was a mixture of country and rhythm and blues. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, his song <i>Maybellene</i> was one of the most popular songs in the country.</p>
