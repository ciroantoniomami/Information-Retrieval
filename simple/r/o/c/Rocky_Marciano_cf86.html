	    <p><b>Rocco Francis Marchegiano</b>, better known as <b>Rocky Marciano</b> (<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">September 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> – <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_31.html" title="August 31">August 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>), was an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxer</a>. Marciano was the World Heavyweight Boxing Champion from September 23, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>, until November 30, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>. Rocky is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest boxers ever. He also had the shortest reach as heavyweight champion, his reach measured only 68 inches, 172/73 cm. He was also a short champion standing 5'11 (180cm). Marciano is the only heavyweight champion in pro boxing and kick boxing history who never lost or drew a professional match. He won an impressive 43 fights by a way of knock out, a 88% KO rate, only former heavyweight champ Vitaly Klitschko had a better KO rate (92%), but he fought less bouts.</p>

<p>Before going pro, Rocky was undefeated as a fighter in the army (nobody knows exactly how many fights he had there). His amateur record was 11-3, one of those fights came by a forfeit when a fighter did not show up for the match. Rocky's first professional fight was in March 1947. Rocky won the championship from Jersey Joe Walcott on September 23 1952. Rocky was named fighter of the year by Ring Magazine three times. His three championship fights between 1952-54 were named fights of the year by that magazine. Rocky's last title bout was against Archie Moore on September 21st <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>. The bout was originally scheduled for Tuesday, September 20th but because of hurricane warnings it had to be moved to the 21st. Marciano was knocked down for two seconds, but he got up and knocked out Moore in the 9th round. Moore was also knocked down in the 6th &amp; 8th round but was saved by the bell. There was a game before the boxing match and all the fights started late. When Rocky was proclaimed winner, it was already morning of September 22nd.</p>
<p>There was some serious talk about Rocky's 50th opponent: Bob Baker, Nino Valdez or Tommy 'Hurricane' Jackson. A bout was to scheduled for Monday, <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2.html" title="January 2">January 2</a> 1956, 11 PM in Miami Beach, FL (if need be, in New York) but due to the lack of sponsors the bout never materialized. If he was to fight on that day, the agreement with International Boxing Club (IBC) and Rocky Marciano was to allow him to keep his championship until Wed, January 2 of 1957. On Wed, December 7th 1955 Bob Baker met Nino Valdez in a 10 round elimination match (also a rematch and originally scheduled for 11 rounds). The match was originally scheduled for December 2 1955, Friday. The winner was to face Rocky Marciano for a heavyweight championship bout, planned for <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2.html" title="January 2">January 2</a> 1956 <a href="http://www.boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=34932" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=34932" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> in Miami Beach, FL. If not, on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_3.html" title="February 3">February 3</a> 1956 in New York, Madison Square Garden. Instead, on February 3rd, Baker lost by Majority Decision to Hurricane Jackson and again on September 26 1956, but this time, he lost by a split decision. Many say this was at least a draw for Baker. Baker was otherwise considered to be one of the best boxers of the 1950's. Valdez was a good boxer, in 1959 he retired due to eye condition. Certain unsavory characters like Arthur Wirtz and Internaional Boxing Club (IBC), headed by Jim Norris did not want Baker to face Floyd Patterson for the world championship, there was too much too lose. On December 7th Baker won his 13th straight (aka Baker's Dozen) by unanimous decision by beating Nino Valdez, thus gaining a respectable 45-5 record, the best on an american contintent, at the time. Unfortunately both Baker and Valdez eliminated themselves from championship consideration by a terrible performance. The Associated Press described the fight as a "dull 10-rounder, fought to the tune of 'Jingle Bells' and 'Let me call you sweetheart' and a steady chorus of boos from the 8 000+ fans." That does not mean that Baker was eliminated as a contender, he was the top rated opponent and challenger for Rocky's title from July 1955 until February 1956.</p>
<p><br />
There was also discussion of a bout with Nino Valdez in Cuba for June 1956 but nothing ever came about. Rocky announced his retirement on April 27 1956. He never fought again, except for one unrecorded match in 1956.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocky_Marciano_cf86.html" title="Edit section: Retirement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement</span></h2>
<p>After his retirement Rocky received some criticism about not fighting Floyd Patterson. The question was how come Rocky did not wait around for Floyd Patterson? In March of 1956 Joe Louis said Floyd is two years away from having any chance of beating Rocky. Floyd had no plans fighting Rocky before 1957, his first intentions were to win light heavyweight for Archie Moore. However there was some talk about Floyd Patterson fighting Rocky on Wednesday Night Fights; either on January 11, 1956, or on January 6 or January 4, 1956, (Floyd's 21st birthday). There was discussion of this 2 rounds bout using 2.5 minute exhibition rounds and being held in Los Angeles, California. It is unknown why the exhibition never came to fruition. During Marciano's reign, Patterson was not a contender for a heavyweight title and he was not a ranked heavyweight. In fact, during the Marciano's reign, Patterson fought below the light heavyweight limit. Only after Marciano's retirement was Patterson OFFICIALLY moved from lightweight rankings to a heavyweight (he entered the rankings as number five on May 2, 1956). Only after Marciano retired did Patterson officially begin fighting above the 175-pound light heavyweight limit. Marciano considered a comeback in 1959 when Ingemar Johansson won the heavyweight championship from Patterson in June 1959. However, since Patterson's contract required a rematch, Rocky had to hope Patterson would loose again in order to get a shot at Ingemar. Rocky was hoping of becoming the first heavy-weight chamption to win the title two times. He wanted to be the only ex champion to regain the title. After almost a month of training, however, Marciano decided against it and never seriously considered a comeback again.</p>

<p>In 1969, on the eve of his 46th birthday, Marciano was a passenger in a small private plane, a Cessna 172 headed to Des Moines, Iowa. It was at night and bad weather set in. The pilot tried to set the plane down on a small airfield outside Newton, Iowa, but hit a tree two miles short of the runway. The passengers died almost instantly. The plane was out of gas as well. Rocky, the young pilot, and another passenger (alleged Iowa mob boss Louis Fratto's 21 year old son) were killed on impact. Marciano was on his way to give a speech to support a friend's son and there was a surprise birthday celebration waiting for him. He had hoped to return early morning for his 46th birthday celebration with his wife. He was coming from a dinner in Chicago at STP CEO Andy Granatelli's home where he reportedly gave Granatelli's son boxing lessons after he was being picked on in school. Rocky was in Chicago, doing a car dealership commercial, it is not known if he had finished it or had plans to return and finish it. Unfortunately for the family, Marciano died intestate (without a will). He is interred in a crypt at Forest Lawn Memorial Cemetery in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. His wife, who died five years after him at the age of 46, is entombed next to him. His father died in March 1973, his mother in January 1986, few days shy of her 85th birthday. In 1970, the Brockton High School Gym was renamed to Brockton Marciano gym. In 1979, a memorial sign was posted.</p>
