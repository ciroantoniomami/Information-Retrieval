	    <p><a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> schools of <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword.html" title="Sword">sword</a> making can be divided into two categories: by the provinces where they were developed and by the masters who created a specific tradition of sword making.</p>
<p>The division by regions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yamato-Den – is the oldest sword smithing traditions of the five. It was renewed in the Kamakura Era (<a href="../../../1/1/9/1192.html" title="1192">1192</a> - 1333 <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anno_Domini_11cb.html" title="Anno Domini">AD</a>). This school was characterized by masters like Hosho, Shikkake, Senjuin, Tegain, and Taima.</li>
<li>Bizen-Den – this tradition was famous for the skills in creation of specific types of hamon (heat treated edge), also called choji. It was developed during the Heian Era (<a href="../../../7/9/4/794.html" title="794">794</a> – 1192 AD). The first masters (according to Nagayama) were the Ko-Bizen School, which was followed by the Ichimonji School. In the mid Kamakura Period the Osafune School was developed as the best known of the system.</li>
<li>Yamashiro-Den - this tradition includes masters like Avataguchi, Gojo, Sanjo, and Rai. It was practiced from the end of the Heian Era (794 – 1192 AD) to the end of Kamakura Era (1192 - 1333 AD).</li>
<li>Soshu-Den - was defined in Kamakura Era (1192 - 1333 AD). It included famous Japanese smiths like Yukimitsu and Masamune who made several innovations.</li>
<li>Mino-Den – is the youngest of the five traditions. The most famous schools were Kanebo, Muramasa and Kamenori. It was practiced from the end of the Kamakura Era (1192 - 1333 AD) until the end of the Muromachi Era(1333-<a href="../../../1/4/6/1467.html" title="1467">1467</a> AD). There are three basic periods: Early Mino (Kaneuji and Kinju Schools), Mid Mino (Naoe Shizu School), and Later Mino (Sue-Seki School). In general the works from the Mino tradition are considered a fine combination of Yamato-den and Soshu-den.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several famous schools created by sword masters: The late Kamakura period is often referred to as the greatest period of sword making in Japanese history. The Soshu tradition was one of the dominant traditions. Smiths like Kunitsuna and Sukezane combined their knowledge with methods from Yamashiro and Bizen traditions. Finally, a group of famous sword smiths culminated with Masamune (<a href="../../../1/2/6/1264.html" title="1264">1264</a>-<a href="../../../1/3/4/1343.html" title="1343">1343</a> AD) and his school. The rare swords were made out of five separate pieces and heat-treated at high <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temperature.html" title="Temperature">temperatures</a>. The swords of the <b>Masamune School</b> were harder than any of the swords made before. Masamune trained a group of at least ten followers. Two of his students (Kanemitsu and Nagayoshi) were from the Bizen province. In this way, during the early 14th century, the Masamune school attracted many smiths from other schools. Kanemitsu is believed to be the one who created the Soden School, which combined Bizen and Soshu techniques.</p>
<p>At the same time <b>Chogi</b> was developing his school. The Chogi works show a stronger <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influence.html" title="Influence">influence</a> of the Soshu tradition than Kanemitsu swords.</p>
<p><b>Nagayoshi</b> made better products by using the best ideas from both the Bizen and Soshu schools. He is considered a skilled Bizen smith who broke away from the long established traditions. He was successful because of the softer Bizen steel which is made at higher temperatures than that of the Soshu school used to be.</p>
<p>Kaneuji I - was one of Masamune's 10 students. It is believed that he created the <b>Mino school</b> in the Shizuyama region. In his creation of swords he used the Shoshu style and added his own methods. Later his tradition was known as the <b>Shizu school</b>. The followers of Kaneuji I (Kaneuji II) moved from Shizuyama to Naoe. This gave another name to the school –<b>Naoeshizu</b>.</p>
<p>Kanemichi I founded the <b>Mishina school</b> in Mino province during the late Muromachi Period (1333-<a href="../../../1/5/7/1573.html" title="1573">1573</a> A.D.). Kanemichi I was the grandson of Kaneuji I (a descendant of Kaneuji- 9th generation). He combined the style of Kaneuji with his own techniques, thus created the Mishina tradition. His swords were appreciated for their quality and sharpness. He was so famous that he received the honorable title of Mitsu-(no)-Kami.</p>
<p>The Kanewaka comes from the Shizu school (Mino). The <b>Kanewaka school</b> founder (Tsujimura Yomonosuke) was the great grandson of Shizu Saburo Kaneuji. Tsujimura Yomonosuke established his school in the Kaga province. In Kaga he and his son create the Kashu Kanewaka School around <a href="../../../1/1/5/1156.html" title="1156">1156</a>-<a href="../../../1/1/5/1159.html" title="1159">1159</a> A.D. It begins as the last of the five traditions.</p>
<p><b>Emperor Gotoba</b> (1184 to <a href="../../../1/1/9/1198.html" title="1198">1198</a> A.D), the 82nd Emperor of Japan was one of the best known sword makers. When he retired, he gathered the best masters of sword making of the time to teach him the secret techniques. Emperor Gotoba and his masters were recognized as the top sword smiths of the Koto era (<a href="../../../9/0/0/900.html" title="900">900</a>-<a href="../../../1/5/3/1530.html" title="1530">1530</a> A.D.).</p>
<p><b>Miyairi Akihira School</b> is a continuation of Soshu tradition. Miyairi Ken-Ichi entered the Kurihara Hikosaburo school (the biggest center of sword making in <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>)in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>). He studied all the five traditions and took the name of his master Akihira. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> he obtained a sword-making license. Then, in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, he changed his name to Yukihira and his school was named after him. His school was based on Soshu-den and Shizu Kaneuji traditions.</p>
