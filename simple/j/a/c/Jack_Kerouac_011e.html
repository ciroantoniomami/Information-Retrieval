	    <p><b>Jean-Louis Lebris de Kerouac</b> (born <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_12.html" title="March 12">March 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> – died <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_21.html" title="October 21">October 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>), better known as <b>Jack Kerouac</b>, was an <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> <a href="../../../a/u/t/Author.html" title="Author">author</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poet.html" title="Poet">poet</a>. He was part of the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Beat_Generation" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Beat_Generation">Beat Generation</a> movement of writers and artists of the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, and gave the movement its name. His most famous work was a long <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> titled <i>On the Road</i>, which was published in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>.</p>
<p>Kerouac was a friend of writers <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Ginsberg_6113.html" title="Allen Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_S._Burroughs_4c27.html" title="William S. Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a>, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and Gregory Corso, among many others. Nearly all of Kerouac's writings were directly based on his own life, but he mostly changed names and details, to protect everyone's privacy. The man he wrote about most was his friend Neal Cassady, who was called "Dean Moriarty" in <i>On the Road</i>. Kerouac influenced many other writers and poets who came along later, and also many <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musician.html" title="Musician">musicians</a> of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, through his works. He also changed the way Americans saw themselves, and their country.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kerouac_011e.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Kerouac was born in Lowell, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/French-Canadian" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:French-Canadian">French-Canadian</a> parents (named Leo and Gabrielle), and was the youngest of three children. He spoke only <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> until he started school. His family was <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>. His father was a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Printer.html" title="Printer">printer</a>, and Kerouac became interested in printed works. He liked to make his own handwritten <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspapers</a> and books. He enjoyed reading, and imitated the styles of writers he liked, such as Thomas Wolfe. He became an expert <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typewriter.html" title="Typewriter">typist</a>, and could type faster than 100 words per minute.</p>
<p>Kerouac was a good <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athlete.html" title="Athlete">athlete</a>, and went to Columbia University in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> on a <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scholarship" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:scholarship">scholarship</a>, but an injury during a practice game ended his football career. He dropped out of Columbia, and devoted himself to writing stories and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Play.html" title="Play">plays</a>. He met Allen Ginsberg at college. Their circle of friends included many future writers and artists, like William S. Burroughs, and Herbert Huncke.</p>
<p>During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Kerouac served in the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merchant_marine.html" title="Merchant marine">Merchant Marine</a>, which made him a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/veteran" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:veteran">veteran</a> of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">military</a>. He kept <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal.html" title="Journal">journals</a> of his experiences, and he used them later to write other works. He was also able to get veteran's benefits later, such as <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">medical</a> help when he was sick with <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/phlebitis" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:phlebitis">phlebitis</a>, and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grant" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:grant">grant</a> money to pay his bills while he wrote. Kerouac was proud to be an American, and always said good things about his country.</p>
<p>Kerouac's father died of stomach <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>. He made Kerouac promise to always work to support his mother. He tried to talk Kerouac out of becoming a writer, because he knew it was hard to succeed in such a career. Kerouac had a hard time staying with any other kind of work, though. He would become impatient or restless, or a disagreement with someone at work would turn into trouble. Kerouac did his best to earn enough money to pay for both his and his mother's living, but his mother also had to work. She was a <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurse.html" title="Nurse">nurse</a>. She worked in a <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory.html" title="Factory">factory</a> when there were no nursing jobs.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kerouac_011e.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h2>
<p>Kerouac published a few <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/short_story" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:short_story">short stories</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/review" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:review">reviews</a> in New York magazines and newspapers in the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>. He worked briefly for his hometown newspaper, <i>The Lowell Sun</i>. His first novel, <i>The Town and the City</i>, was published in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>. For his second novel, Kerouac wanted to write a book about <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cross_country" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:cross_country">cross-country</a> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/road_trip" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:road_trip">road trips</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitchhiking.html" title="Hitchhiking">hitchhiking</a>. Hitchhiking was safer to do in the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>, in America, than it is today. Kerouac stopped and restarted writing this book several times. Kerouac didn't want to just tell an ordinary story. He wanted to give an idea of how the people he met thought things through, and expressed this to each other, along with telling what they did and said. He also knew he needed more experiences, to tell a better story.</p>
<p>Many experiences came through Kerouac's friendship with Neal Cassady. Cassady was a handsome, bright young <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/drifter" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:drifter">drifter</a> with a <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teenage.html" title="Teenage">teenaged</a> wife, named Luanne Henderson. Cassady and Luanne had a hard relationship, and broke up and got back together many times. He later married another woman named Carolyn Robinson, who was older than Luanne and understood him better, but Carolyn and Cassady also had troubles. Kerouac was briefly married, to girlfriend Edie Parker. They didn't stay together long, and were soon <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/divorce" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:divorce">divorced</a>. Cassady taught Kerouac, who never had a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/driver%27s_license" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:driver's_license">driver's license</a>, how to drive, while Kerouac taught Cassady about writing.</p>
<p>Neal Cassady traveled back and forth across the country, usually driving cars like Hudson Hornets at high speed. He looked for jobs, fresh experiences, and new friends. Kerouac began to travel with him. They lived in and visited cities such as <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver.html" title="Denver">Denver</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, Monterey, and even <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico_City_fae1.html" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a>. They also looked sometimes for Cassady's father, who disappeared years earlier. Kerouac got sick in Mexico City, and Cassady left him behind at the hospital. Kerouac had to make his own way home. He took this very hard, and was angry with Cassady. He forgave him later, when they met again, and he made Cassady the central character of his new book. One job Kerouac could fall back on, thanks to Cassady, was as a <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railroad.html" title="Railroad">railroad</a> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/brakeman" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:brakeman">brakeman</a>.</p>
<p>Many people in the 1940s and 1950s used <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stimulant" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:stimulant">stimulant</a> drugs such as <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/benzedrine" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:benzedrine">benzedrine</a>, to help them stay alert. <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">Jazz</a> music was also popular, and some jazz musicians and listeners smoked <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana.html" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a>. Kerouac was influenced by both drugs, and they changed the way he wrote. He began to write what he called "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spontaneous" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:spontaneous">spontaneous</a> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prose" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:prose">prose</a>", jotting down words in much the same way a musician <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/improvise" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:improvise">improvises</a> a solo in a song. (Kerouac played no musical instruments, but could <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scat" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:scat">scat sing</a> well, and had many of the same instincts as a musician.) His new writing style was strange to many people, and even seen as bad by some older authors and critics. It was six years before Kerouac published his second novel.</p>
<p>The version of <i>On the Road</i> that finally satisfied Kerouac was written over three weeks in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>. It was typed on a single roll of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/teletype" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:teletype">teletype</a> paper. Kerouac liked to type on rolls of paper, because he didn't have to stop to change pages. He had just gotten married for the second time, to Joan Haverty. The manuscript was Kerouac's way to explain his friendship with Neal Cassady to his new wife. The explanation made a fine rough draft for a novel, but it didn't help his marriage. Joan felt that Kerouac's nonstop work on the manuscript was an <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/obsession" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:obsession">obsession</a>, and she didn't want to stay married to him after it was finished. They were soon divorced, as he was with his first wife.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editor.html" title="Editor">editor</a> who worked on <i>The Town and the City</i> found the long, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scroll" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:scroll">scroll</a>-like manuscript hard to understand, and even harder to work with. Kerouac's publisher rejected the novel, as did every other publisher he went to. Nor was anyone interested in <i>The Subterraneans</i>, a shorter novel he wrote in three nights, about his romance with an <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-American</a> woman. Such a relationship was <a href="../../../t/a/b/Taboo.html" title="Taboo">taboo</a> in America during the 1950s. Kerouac continued to write, from short stories and essays to long novels, and even <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.html" title="Poetry">poetry</a>. He tried many different subjects, but had almost nothing published. He also worked different jobs, including brakeman and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/night_watchman" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:night_watchman">night watchman</a>.</p>
<p>It turned out that Joan Haverty was pregnant by Kerouac, and she gave birth to a daughter, Jan-Michelle. Kerouac denied he was the father at first, but a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blood_test" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:blood_test">blood test</a> later proved it was likely. She also grew to look like him, and he accepted her as his child. Joan sued Kerouac for <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/child_support" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:child_support">child support</a>, but he was ill and could not work at the time, and she collected almost no money. Kerouac only saw Jan a few times, but talked to her more often by telephone. Joan mostly kept them apart.</p>

<p>When Allen Ginsberg became well-known through his writings in the mid-1950s, he asked the people who liked him to give Kerouac and his works a chance. Finally Viking Press agreed to publish <i>On the Road</i>, after many changes to the manuscript. The novel became a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/best-seller" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:best-seller">best-seller</a>, and Kerouac was a celebrity after years of little success. Magazines began to request articles and essays from him. He appeared on many <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> programs, including <i>The Steve Allen Show</i>. Steve Allen liked him, and they recorded an <a href="../../../a/l/b/Album.html" title="Album">album</a> together, with Kerouac reading aloud and Allen playing <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a>. He recorded another album later, with jazz musicians Al Cohn and Zoot Sims.</p>
<p>Kerouac wrote and published more novels, including <i>The Dharma Bums</i>, <i>Doctor Sax</i>, <i>Maggie Cassidy</i>, <i>Visions of Gerard</i> (a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/memoir" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:memoir">memoir</a> of his older brother, who died in childhood), <i>Big Sur</i> (about the stresses brought on by fame, and how the people he knew saw him differently), <i>Desolation Angels</i>, and <i>Book of Dreams</i> (a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dream_journal" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:dream_journal">dream journal</a>). He studied <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, and this also influenced his writing. He wrote <i>Some of the Dharma</i> as an introduction to Buddhism, though he remained a Catholic.</p>
<p>As Kerouac, Ginsberg, and their friends became famous, a trend among the group of writers and artists was noticed, and was written about in the mainstream <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media.html" title="Media">media</a>. Kerouac was asked to describe his generation. He explained that the pressures of <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> living had 'beaten' normal ways of thinking and working out of them, and they prefered the beat of <a href="../../../b/e/b/Bebop.html" title="Bebop">bebop</a> and jazz to most other music, "so I guess you could say we're a <i>beat generation</i>."</p>
<p>"Beat Generation" became the name for the new sense of style coming from artists and writers in New York and San Francisco. Kerouac's circle of friends and acquaintances (and their imitators) were called the Beats, with Kerouac himself called "King of the Beats" by the media. (The term was later parodied as "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beatnik" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:beatnik">beatniks</a>", implying such people were <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communists</a>, and would hurt the country.) Kerouac narrated a movie, called <i>Pull My Daisy</i>, about the Beat <a href="../../../p/h/e/Phenomenon.html" title="Phenomenon">phenomenon</a>.</p>
<p>An ongoing problem Kerouac had with fame was that people thought he did all the things he wrote about. Much of what he described (like Neal Cassady's lawless nature, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/promiscuous" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:promiscuous">promiscuity</a>, and drug use) was only what he saw in other people. Not everyone who read Kerouac's stories understood this. Some people wanted to blame him for doing bad things, or getting others to do them. Other people wanted to do those kinds of things with Kerouac. Shy by nature, Kerouac pulled away. He became almost a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/recluse" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:recluse">recluse</a> in the house he bought for his mother. He also began to abuse <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kerouac_011e.html" title="Edit section: Later life and career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later life and career</span></h2>
<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, American society went through many changes, in part because of the influence of the Beats. Many young people read <i>On the Road</i>, and saw things they related to, and it made them want to experience more in their own lives. Other writers liked the looseness of Kerouac's style, and it made them think more about their own writing, how to study life, and how to better express themselves. Many musicians were affected by Kerouac's books, including <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donovan.html" title="Donovan">Donovan</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Doors_4c4f.html" title="The Doors">The Doors</a>.</p>
<p>Kerouac was more disappointed than happy to be famous. Even though he liked some of what he inspired, he felt that the public largely got the wrong message from his books. He saw many people take what the Beats wrote as a kind of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/permission" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:permission">permission</a> to get into trouble, or <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abandon" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:abandon">abandon</a> (give up) people and things they cared about. He felt <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sympathy" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:sympathy">sympathy</a> for the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hippie" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:hippie">hippies</a>, but disagreed with them on the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, the role of <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">government</a>, and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/patriotism" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:patriotism">patriotism</a>. He also lost some of his old friends, when their views differed.</p>
<p>Kerouac still abused alcohol and other drugs, and it harmed his health. He became bloated and irritable, and looked drunk on his last television appearance, on William F. Buckley's <i>Firing Line</i> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>. He married for the third time, to Stella Sampas, the sister of a boyhood friend. Stella looked after Kerouac and his mother, kept the public and others away, and tried to get him to stop drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>His daughter Jan-Michelle also began to write during her teen years. He gave her his <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blessing" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:blessing">blessing</a>, and told her "You can use my (last) name." She wrote under the name <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Kerouac_326d.html" title="Jan Kerouac">Jan Kerouac</a>, and published novels and stories herself, from the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> to the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>. Kerouac's mother became sick, and he sometimes worked at her bedside on stories. She helped him work out the ending of <i>Pic</i>, his novel about a young African-American.</p>
<p>Kerouac wrote and reworked new material until the last day of his life. He died during <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/emergency" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:emergency">emergency</a> <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgery</a>, to try to repair a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hemorrhage" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:hemorrhage">hemorrhage</a> caused by his alcohol abuse. He was buried in his hometown, and was hardly remembered there at first. Even though he was world famous, Kerouac earned very little money as a writer. He died with only a few hundred dollars in the bank. It was years before his grave received a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headstone.html" title="Headstone">headstone</a>.</p>
<p>Neal Cassady died more than a year before, of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/exposure" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:exposure">exposure</a>, alongside a railroad track in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. He set out to become a writer or musician, but he never got far with either. He only published one book, <i>The First Third</i>, which was about his youth. Cassady earned most of his money from <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/labor" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:labor">labor</a>, and was often out of work and owed money. He spent a long time in jail after he was <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/arrest" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:arrest">arrested</a> for selling marijuana. Sometimes the fact that Cassady was well-known through Kerouac kept him from having the life he wanted. Cassady had a family with Carolyn, but she had to both work, and raise the children when her husband was away. Carolyn later wrote a memoir.</p>

<p>Kerouac's works, especially <i>On the Road</i>, are now more popular than ever. Generations have discovered his works, as a means of learning about life and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attitude" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:attitude">attitudes</a> in America during his lifetime, as a way to measure their own sense of experience, or as examples of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/free_association" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:free_association">free association</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stream_of_consciousness" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:stream_of_consciousness">stream of consciousness</a> in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/creative_writing" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:creative_writing">creative writing</a>.</p>
<p>Less than half of Kerouac's writings were published during his lifetime, but nearly all are now available. The ones published later drew hundreds of times more money than his most famous works, when they first appeared. His hometown Lowell remembers Kerouac today with a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/memorial" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:memorial">memorial</a>, and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cultural" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:cultural">cultural</a> events every year. His grave now has a headstone, which reads "He honored life".</p>

<p><i>The Subterraneans</i> was made into a movie by MGM in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, but the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/storyline" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:storyline">storyline</a> was almost completely different from the book. <i>On the Road</i> was considered many times to be made into a movie, once with actor <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlon_Brando_e47f.html" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a> as Dean Moriarty and another time with Sean Penn, but this never got farther than <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/negotiation" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:negotiation">negotiations</a>. The movie rights were recently resold, for more than ten times Kerouac's lifetime earnings.</p>
<p>A movie, <i>Heart Beat</i>, was made in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>, about the relationship between Carolyn Robinson, Neal Cassady and Jack Kerouac. It starred Sissy Spacek, Nick Nolte, and John Heard.</p>
<p>Kerouac appears as "Hank" in William S. Burroughs's novel <i>Naked Lunch</i>, and was played by Nicholas Campbell in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> movie version.</p>
<p>He was also the subject of a song by 10,000 Maniacs, "Hey Jack Kerouac".</p>
