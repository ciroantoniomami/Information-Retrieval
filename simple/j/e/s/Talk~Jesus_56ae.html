	    <p>Troll: 72.130.78.108</p>
<p>This person is adding lots of blatantly immature "qualifiers" to the article such as, after the sentence on Christmas: "though overwheling evidence shows that he wasn't born on that day or month, but is an adopted pagan holiday (see any history channel episode about Christmas)." He even attempted to end the article with this: "Then again most people endorse war even if it is one memeber of their religion killing another, or even brother against brother, i.e. World War I and II in which millions of christians murdered each other and claimed that God laughed with joy he was so happy about it."</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>I expanded the section on Jesus's divinity a bit, and added the verses that most Christians cite for proof of his divinity. But it just occured to me that the translation I used (though a highly accurate and respected one) isn't in simple english. I didn't want to use a paraphrased version like the Message though as it might have looked misleading. Still, I think showing the verses and the reasons why most Christians think Jesus is God is helpful, as someone completely unfamiliar with Christianity and the Bible might want to know WHY Christians believe that doctrine. Is there a friendlier, but still accurate translation anyone recommends instead?</p>
<hr />
<p><br />
Jesus is a common name in Latin American countries. Should the title of the page with the article about Jesus (Christ) be "Jesus Christ", or should the title of this page be "Jesus"? What do you think?</p>

<p>Buh, this article presents historical aspects of Jesus as factual, conflating them with what stories say. I understand simple wikipedia is not the place for complex presentation, but deliberately misleading articles aren't impressive either.</p>

<p>The Bible is a source document and will often be relevant to this page. But it is not <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">Neutural Point of View</a>. The Bible (or at least sections) has been written by people holding specific faith POV who wanted to instruct others in that faith (EG See John 20:31). See I just used the Bible as a source document - to show why it is not a NPOV historical source. A way around this is to use begining qualifies such as "In the gospel's Jesus is described ..."

This was about a link “*<a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/dp5/jesus.htm" class="external text" title="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/dp5/jesus.htm" rel="nofollow">Who was the real Jesus?</a> Seemingly unique compilation from a theosophical point of view.” I added to the page at <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" class="external autonumber" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Hello, people! Hello, Ricky81682!</p>
<p>Well, I'm not a native English speaker, and I think my English level is not enough to respond the way I'd like to do it. Now, I'm sorry if I made one or more mistakes, it wasn't my intention. I received this strong warning one time only, I think that would be enough, but I don't know how many times you said it.</p>
<p>I do not consider myself to be an impolite person, so I’m answering this warning because of respect mainly. Well, that link leads to very important information (I think) about the one called Jesus. I think that information is about Jesus from a theosophical perspective, as well as from the author’s perspective, of course. There seems to be historical information in it, too. Also, I think it is a compilation from various sources; the author provides information about those sources.</p>
<p>Thinking about why that link shouldn’t be in that page, now I realize the reason may be that ‘Who was the real Jesus?’ is not written in Simple English, so if that’s the case, I apologize and ask forgiveness. Otherwise, I think the link is valid, useful, and a valuable addition to the page (<a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" class="external autonumber" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). It happened to me that viewing Wikipedia pages written in different languages, I found in some or many pages —written in a determined language— external links to pages written in other languages. Since I consider my English poor, I thought I could contribute at least with a link to a good and poorly known perspective.</p>
<p>My intention is not to vandalize but to contribute, and given this situation it’s been difficult to do this, since I live in an impoverished ‘third world’ country (Argentina), I do not have a job, I’m trying to study, and the expenditure of some money is significant to me. It seems a little frustrating trying twice to add a simple link, then finding it is not there anymore, one also fantasizes about some kind of “censorship”. Again, if I’m wrong about something, please forgive me, I’ll try to improve myself. I didn’t think that link was inappropriate in there. I hope no harm is been done (at least, not a great one). Also I’m new on this, and I’m trying to learn.</p>
<p>Am I partially right/wrong?</p>
<p>Please, try writing more careful warnings. I apologize about my English, it took some effort to redact this answer.</p>
<p>Sincerely, I wish the best for all of you. Thank you!</p>

<p>Can we discuss this here, as opposed to making endless reversions? I mean you two, 72.130.78.108 and 71.243.14.236. I'm not specifically involved, but I want the revert-warring to stop. So here are the five major opinions of the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewpoint of Monophysites: Jesus is God.</li>
<li>Viewpoint of Dyophysites: Jesus is the Son of God.</li>
<li>Viewpoint of Islam: Jesus was a prophet.</li>
<li>Viewpoint of smaller religions: Depends.</li>
<li>Viewpoint of atheism: Jesus was a normal human.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can anyone think of how to work these all into the article, without more fighting? <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPicaroon9288_bfd0.html" title="User:Picaroon9288">Picaroon9288</a> 22:47, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>the revert warring hasn't been that bad. One of the two is a borderline troll, as was pointed out. The breakdown is a little different than you have stated. It's true that Monophysites believe strongly that Jesus is God. But the fact is that the creeds of ALL Trinitarian Christians, not just Monophysites, state this, as they all agree Jesus is part of the Trinity of God: God the Son. (not just the "Son of God". So, your first bullet above should read "Viewpoint of Trinitarians". The Miaphysite / Diophysite controversy is actually over whether his God-part and his human part are United and Inseparable, or two distinct natures. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 23:20, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was using "endless reversions" to show what it could become; I'm aware that it's not that bad now. Also, thanks for informing me of a better breakdown of the viewpoints. &#160;:) <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPicaroon9288_bfd0.html" title="User:Picaroon9288">Picaroon9288</a> 03:42, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also some people beleive Jesus is God without beeing card-carrying creedal Trinitarians. The Christian Church - Churches of Christ - Disciples of Christ family of churches are sometimes ambivilent about the Trinity because they come from a restoration movement that uses only the Christian Scriptures as authority and not the doctirnes (such as the Trinity) that were developed later.

<p>Twice someone has removed the reference to Jesus rejecting the temple. And this latexst time it was called 'innacurate'. I'm putting it back in again and here is why: I'm reading Mark 11 and he sure curses a fig tree for not being fruitful; uptruns the temple targeting those who exploit the foreigners (those who need money changers) and poor women (those who bought doves rather than more expensive sacrifices) and picketing the whole place "not allowing anyone to carry anything through it"; quotes the prophets previous condemations of the Jewish leaders and their trust in the temple saying they ahve "made it a den of robbers"; suggests that "this" mountian the temple mount should be cast into the sea; exposes that the chief priests are more concerned with what the crowd thinks of them than what God thinks of them. And in Chapter 12 tells a parable "against the cheif preists, scribes and elders" to proclaim the truth about the evil way absentee landlords try and usurp the role of God; exposes that the Pharisees are walking around the temple with idolitrious and blasphemous Roman coins and "belong to Caesar"; expose the Sadduccees trating women like objects; and teaches his disciples the theory that "they devour widow's houses" before taking them into the temple sitting opposite the treasury and demonstrating how it happens as a widown who should have been able to receive from the temple gives everything she had. OUTRAGOUS! And so on to chapter 13 where Jesus foretells that the temple and its large stones are not beautiful - they will be torn down and the temple destroyed.--Just nigel 04:28, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
