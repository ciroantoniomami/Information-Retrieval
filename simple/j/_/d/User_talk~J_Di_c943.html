<p>Hello J Di, and welcome to Simple Wikipedia. Unlike the way normal users do a rollback (re-edit an old version, commit the changes) administrative rollback does not give the opportunity to make a comment about it. In the case we are talking about (<a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=255533" class="external autonumber" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=255533" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), I simply felt rolling back would be faster than re-entering the comment. This is nothing personal against a given user. As you are probably aware, I have made a deletion/rename request for this page, as well as one other in the scope of Cowboy Bebop. I did this simply to prevent that simple-wp returns completely different results from en-wp, when searching for common terms. The other option I would have had was to re-add the deletion request; the result would have been the same.</p>
<p>If anything is unclear, please get back to me. -- <a href="../../../e/p/t/User%7EEptalon_a472.html" title="User:Eptalon">Eptalon</a> 10:13, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know how administrator rollback works, and as I said before, I'd rather not have my good faith edits revered with it; it gives me the impression that I am not worth your time. Reverting a page by editing an older revision is not a time-consuming process, and using an edit summary saves other users from feeling belittled or unwanted. Not everybody knows what administrator rollback is or how it works, and new editors could mistake an automatic edit summary for rejection. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">J Di</a> 14:56, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's no real big deal. What happened is that first, on Nov. 22, someone made up a nonsense talk page at Talk:Zatch Bell. Then you noticed that the article page should be at Zatch Bell! and did a page move, nonsense talk page and all. This automatically created a redirect for the nonsense talk page too. Pretty soon afterward, the nonsense talk page got deleted at its new location, this was all on Nov. 22. Whenever any page is deleted, all redirects pointing to it also should also eventually be deleted, because they show up as "broken" redirects - orphaned redirects that point to nothing. I may well have been the first person to check the broken redirect list since Nov 22. Since it's a talk page and there's nothing there anyway, I don't see how anyone would be inconvenienced. <i><a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User_talk%7EBlockinblox_5d15.html" title="User talk:Blockinblox">talk</a></i> 22:37, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, I didn't realise there was a talk page when I moved the article; I was wondering why there was a redirect to the talk page.

<p>Currently I am runing to become a sysop. The main reason why I want to become one is to better help in the war against vandalism, I believe in tougher blocks against vandals and after the 2 time they vandaliz an article I will impose a ban on them. I have a lot of free time so I will be a active sysop. At one point I had a average of 50 edits a day, now I have a average of 30 because I was busy and not able to edit. If you have any questions ask me on my talk page please. Have a nice week and god bless.--Sir James Paul 21:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I changed the article a little, I made it more simple. I am going to do research on him and add some new stuff to it. The reason why the article was the exact same was because I only had a few min to simplify it. I did it a little more after sending you the message.

<dd>Good point. I think the whole article could be expanded to cover footballers in the different leagues... We could have an article that's better than its English Wikipedia counterpart! <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">J Di</a> 15:22, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also looking at the changes, a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>With the change from football player to footballers (rather than football players), now the category English football players should be changed to English footballers for consistency.</li>
<li>Cat:American football really needs to come out of footballers as the category is about the sport, not the players themselves. American football players (which there are not currently enough article for)would fit, but not the main category for the sport itself. -- <font color="#770044"><b><a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreol_5a8b.html" title="User:Creol">Creol</a></b><small>(<a href="../../../c/r/e/User_talk%7ECreol_0bce.html" title="User talk:Creol">talk</a>)</small></font> 15:31, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I noticed both of them not long ago. I think the categories should be changed, but I'm not sure about calling them English footballers and American footballers. I think they should be called Association football players and American football players or something like that so it's more clear that the category is categorising people by the sport they play, and not by where they were born. Thinking about it now, it might be a good idea to rename the Football category to Football players, so that there's some consistency. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">J Di</a> 15:36, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Using English football players is both grouping similar articles and cutting down on clutter. It allows for the entire group (all English people who play football) to be placed in multiple categories at the same time without having to enter it each time on each page. Rather than having to enter English people and football players, putting them in the category and linking the category save time with changes, keeps the players pages a little cleaner, and helps reduce the number of articles on the category pages. If we had 20 athletes from 20 different countries, that would be 2 completely full pages of info for the one category. With english football players (and french, and german, etc) we would have only 20 on the main page - less of a mess and easier to locate (if you know the country.. Alphabetical list of players with countries in the main cat could come in handy at times). Sorting by commonality at the lowest level currently possible just seems to work out for the best -- <font color="#770044"><b><a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreol_5a8b.html" title="User:Creol">Creol</a></b><small>(<a href="../../../c/r/e/User_talk%7ECreol_0bce.html" title="User talk:Creol">talk</a>)</small></font> 15:48, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

I had seen only a small amount of G-spot vibrator, but what I did see of it did not appear to be pornographic. Nobody is forcing Simple English Wikipedia to have only articles about human sexuality, but from where I'm sitting it looks as though you'd rather there were none. <a href="../../../../en/w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" class="extiw" title="en:Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not">Wikipedia is not censored</a>, and as there are no policies specific to censorship on Simple English Wikipedia, I do not believe that one administrator should be allowed to single-handedly carry out such an action as this and then refuse to have that action fairly reviewed when it is contested. "<a href="../../../../en/c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" class="extiw" title="en:Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia works by building consensus</a>", and it has the right to decide as a community whether or not these articles should be here.

<dd>I must disagree with your assessment of <a href="../../../g/-/s/G-spot_vibrator.html" title="G-spot vibrator">G-spot vibrator</a>, it is strictly pornographic / instructional and has no information of legitimate interest to this project. It even contains spam links to websites whose primary (only) purpose is to sell sex toys. Such articles have always been routinely deleted, and there have indeed been discussions last November where consensus was reached by the community (including Netoholic and Archer7 who agreed with me on Zephyr2k's talk, and the conversation was continued on Simple talk) on the appropriate level of censorship here. In response to your other statement that it looks to you like I would rather there were no articles about human sexuality, please note <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_deletion_Log_2_a9c4.html#Sexual_reproduction" title="Wikipedia:Requests for deletion/Log 2">Wikipedia:Requests_for_deletion/Log_2#Sexual_reproduction</a> where I applied this same standard, to vote to <i>keep</i> the article <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_reproduction.html" title="Sexual reproduction">Sexual reproduction</a> that someone had proposed for deletion. Human sexuality is of course a legitimate field of study with useful information. Articles about how to use and where to buy vibrators and dildoes are non-core to say the least and seem like someone is only trying to test the limits of how provocative they can make the encyclopedia. If you truly wish to pursue this, I suggest holding a "request for undeletion" beforehand, and if there is community consensus that an article specifically about the G-spot vibrator has any positive value, only then I will undelete it. <i><a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User_talk%7EBlockinblox_5d15.html" title="User talk:Blockinblox">talk</a></i> 14:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, I think you mean the interwikimedia links. You can add an interwiki link for a Simple English Wikipedia page in any other Wikipedia by adding <code>[[simple:<i>article name</i>]]</code> to a page.

<dd>There have been a few discussions about WikiProjects and something that comes up a lot is that there are not enough regular contributors on this wiki for a WikiProject to work efficiently. May want to look at <a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia%7ESimple_talk_Archive_5_fae5.html#Wikiprojects" title="Wikipedia:Simple talk/Archive 5">Wikipedia:Simple talk/Archive 5#Wikiprojects</a>, the only discussion I can find at the moment, and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">Wikipedia:WikiProject</a>, which appears to have some misleading information in it. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">J Di</a> 23:54, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I guess it depends on how you look at it; I don't really think there are that many regular editors to motivate and WikiProjects may make collaborative efforts more difficult to manage.
