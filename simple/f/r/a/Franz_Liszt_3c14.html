<p><b>Franz Liszt</b> (born Raiding, nr. Sopron, <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_22.html" title="October 22">October 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/1/1811.html" title="1811">1811</a>; died <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayreuth.html" title="Bayreuth">Bayreuth</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_31.html" title="July 31">July 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1886.html" title="1886">1886</a>)) was a <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungarian</a> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Composer.html" title="Composer">composer</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/a/Pianist.html" title="Pianist">pianist</a>. Liszt (pronounced like “list”) was one of the most important <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musician.html" title="Musician">musicians</a> of the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>. He was the greatest pianist of his time and went on lots of tours through <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> where everyone filled the concert halls to hear him. He wrote a lot of music for piano. Many of his piano pieces were harder to play than anything that had been written before. In this way he developed the <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technique.html" title="Technique">technique</a> of piano playing, setting new standards for the future. In his compositions he often used new ideas which sounded very modern in his time. He was very helpful to other composers who lived at that time, helping them to become better known by conducting their works and playing some of their orchestral pieces on the piano.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Liszt_3c14.html" title="Edit section: Early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h2>
<p>Liszt’s father was an official who worked for Prince Nikolaus Esterházy, the same noble family who employed the composer <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Haydn_fcd5.html" title="Joseph Haydn">Joseph Haydn</a>. When he was seven his father started to teach him the piano. He was a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_prodigy.html" title="Child prodigy">child prodigy</a>, and within a year or two he was already playing in concerts. He was so promising that some rich Hungarians said they would pay for his music <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education.html" title="Education">education</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/2/1821.html" title="1821">1821</a> his family moved to <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>. He had piano lessons from Czerny and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Composition.html" title="Composition">composition</a> lessons from Salieri. He soon became famous although he was still a young boy, and he met famous musicians like <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beethoven.html" title="Beethoven">Beethoven</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Schubert_d1e2.html" title="Franz Schubert">Schubert</a>. Beethoven is supposed to have kissed him on the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forehead.html" title="Forehead">forehead</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/2/1823.html" title="1823">1823</a> his family moved again, this time to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>. He wanted to go to the Conservatoire to study music but Luigi Cherubini would not let him in because he was a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreigner.html" title="Foreigner">foreigner</a> (i.e. not <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a>). So he studied <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_theory.html" title="Music theory">music theory</a> privately with Reicha and composition with Paer. Soon he was asked to play the piano everywhere in Paris. He travelled to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. On his second visit there in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1825.html" title="1825">1825</a> he played to King George IV at Windsor.</p>
<p>Liszt continued to travel to other countries. After his father died he became a piano teacher in Paris. He fell in love with one of his pupils. It was the first of many love affairs he had with various women. He read a lot of books to try to educate himself properly. He met <a href="../../../h/e/c/Hector_Berlioz_f68e.html" title="Hector Berlioz">Berlioz</a> and he liked the music of Berlioz very much. In <a href="../../../1/8/3/1831.html" title="1831">1831</a> he met the <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violin.html" title="Violin">violinist</a> Nicolò Paganini and he was amazed by his <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtuoso.html" title="Virtuoso">virtuoso</a> playing. Liszt was to do for the piano what Paganini had done for the violin. Both men were drawn by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon.html" title="Cartoon">cartoonists</a> as <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil.html" title="Devil">devilish</a> characters. Both men wrote music which was incredibly hard for their instruments.</p>
<p>Soon Liszt met a Countess called Marie d’Agoult. He began to have an affair with her. The Countess left her husband and went to live with Liszt in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva.html" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>. They lived together for several years and had three children. When Liszt gave away a lot of his money to help pay for a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monument.html" title="Monument">monument</a> to Beethoven in <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonn.html" title="Bonn">Bonn</a> he had to earn money by going on tours again, so the countess left him. He still saw her and the children every summer for a few years but finally they separated completely.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Liszt_3c14.html" title="Edit section: Years of touring">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Years of touring</span></h2>
<p>Liszt spent all his time giving piano concerts everywhere in Europe. He was famous everywhere he went. He visited England again, but people were not so enthusiastic about him this time. This may be because they were shocked about his love affairs.</p>
<p>In 1847 he met Princess Carolyne Sayn-Wittgenstein in <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>. She was to be the most important person in his life from then on. Her brother was the <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsar.html" title="Tsar">tsar</a> of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>. She persuaded him to stop travelling all the time and spend his time composing. He took up a full-time job of conducting in <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weimar.html" title="Weimar">Weimar</a>. During the next twelve years he wrote nearly all the great works for which he is famous. He <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conducting.html" title="Conducting">conducted</a> <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">operas</a> by composers like <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Wagner_c988.html" title="Richard Wagner">Wagner</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Schumann_9001.html" title="Robert Schumann">Schumann</a> , Berlioz, <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuseppe_Verdi_b105.html" title="Giuseppe Verdi">Verdi</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaetano_Donizetti_d61c.html" title="Gaetano Donizetti">Donizetti</a>. He composed pieces for his <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orchestra.html" title="Orchestra">orchestra</a> to play. He made Weimar famous as a centre for modern music.</p>
<p>Not everybody liked him. The Weimar court did not approve of him because he played a lot of music by Wagner who was then living in <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> as a political <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refugee.html" title="Refugee">refugee</a>. Liszt had helped Wagner to escape from Germany in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1849.html" title="1849">1849</a>. Many people, including the Tsar of Russia, did not approve of Liszt’s living together with Princess Carolyne because she was already married. In the end he resigned from his job in Weimar. He travelled to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> where he hoped the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">pope</a> would let Princess Carolyne divorce her husband, he did not.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Liszt_3c14.html" title="Edit section: Later years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later years</span></h2>
<p>Liszt spent eight years in Rome. He wrote a lot of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religious</a> music and took orders in the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> church. His daughter Cosima, who had married a famous conductor Hans von Bülow, left her husband and lived with Wagner. They had two children together. Liszt and Wagner quarrelled for many years about this.</p>
<p>Liszt spent most of his last years travelling to and fro between three cities: Rome, Weimar and <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>. He called this his “vie trifurquée” (three-forked life). He died in Weimar in 1881.</p>
<p><a name="His_personality" id="His_personality"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Liszt_3c14.html" title="Edit section: His personality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">His personality</span></h2>
<p>Liszt had a very strong personality which affected everyone he met. When he played the piano at concerts he was a great showman. A lot of people drew caricatures of him playing the piano with his wild mop of hair. He could be very polite and knew how to get on with the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristocracy.html" title="Aristocracy">aristocracy</a>. He could be very generous, giving both money and time to other musicians and giving praise where it was deserved. He was a powerful, unique character.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><a name="Compositions" id="Compositions"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Liszt_3c14.html" title="Edit section: Compositions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Compositions</span></h2>
<p>Most of Liszt’s compositions were for piano. He wrote one piano <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonata.html" title="Sonata">sonata</a>. Its form is very different from the sonatas of composers like Beethoven. It is a very <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romantic_music.html" title="Romantic music">Romantic</a> work, but it does not tell a story like a lot of Romantic pieces do. Mostly his piano works are shorter pieces which are quite free in form. He often took a theme and transforms it (changes it gradually). He wrote <a href="../../../%C3%A9/t/u/%C3%89tude.html" title="Étude">studies</a> which are much more than just pieces to improve one’s piano <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technique.html" title="Technique">technique</a>. They are great music. One collection is called <i>Transcendental Studies</i>. In Switzerland he wrote <i>Années de pèlerinage</i> (Years of Wandering), a collection of pieces to which he gave titles later. Liszt explored all the possible sounds that the piano could make (it was still a fairly new instrument). Sometimes he made it sound like an orchestra. Some of his last piano works are much simpler to play, although the chords would have sounded very modern for his time. They are like the Impressionistic music of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Debussy_89de.html" title="Claude Debussy">Debussy</a>.</p>
<p>Not all Liszt’s piano pieces were original compositions: he also made arrangements or transcriptions. It seems a strange idea to us now to take someone else’s symphony and arrange it for piano. This is what Liszt often did. He took symphonies by Beethoven or <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lied.html" title="Lied">songs</a> by Schubert and changed them so that they could be played on the piano. Many people did not have the opportunity to hear concerts very often, and they certainly did not have radios or CDs, so Liszt was making these works more famous, helping them to reach a wider audience. He often made difficult transcriptions which meant that he changed the pieces and added a lot of extra ornamental notes, making a new piece out of an old one.</p>
<p>Liszt’s orchestral music is also very important. He wrote <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphonic_poem.html" title="Symphonic poem">symphonic poems</a>: pieces which tell a story or describe something. The best known one is called <i>Les préludes</i>. He also wrote two piano <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concerto.html" title="Concerto">concertos</a>.</p>
<p>He wrote a lot of church music. Church music was often quite sentimental in those days, but Liszt tried to make his works help people to feel religious devotion.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Liszt_3c14.html" title="Edit section: Conclusion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>In many ways Liszt was typical of the Romantic <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artist.html" title="Artist">artist</a>. He was always looking for a spiritual meaning to life. He carried a walking stick with the heads of St Francis of Assisi and Gretchen and Mephistopheles, characters from Goethe’s Faust. He was a 19th century musician but through his thinking and his music he looked forward to the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>.</p>
