<p>My original account was called User:Reri Horlockon but that was hacked by the 63 vandal and blocked. It was hacked in June, although I can not remember vandlizing Archer7's page, which was before than. PLEASE UNBLOCK. The vandal has been range blocked so it should be safe to do so.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what part of that edit you mean by "correcting British English to American English... It must be "learnt" v. "learned"...? If so, did not realize one was "British" and one was "American" spelling; in fact I'm not sure that is the case... I think both spellings are used in both countries, actually... I just felt that "learned" is preferable as it is slightly more literary and less colloquial than "learnt", especially in an article about <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literacy.html" title="Literacy">literacy</a>...! ("Learnt" to me just sounds kind of hokey, like "I learnt how to read when I was 6") <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 17:41, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The IP 212.219.82.35 - the weird one with the self-reversion is a school IP, my school IP. A friend vandalises, I spotted it and reverted without logging in. I recommend blocking, it's already blocked of EN and they won't stop until we are blocked. Minimise the damage, I'll sort out the rest.</p>
<p>I'll still be able to edit from home, it's just a shame there's sad (insert word here) like that setting out to ruin it. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">Archer7</a> 13:33, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know you're not an admin, I just thought I'd better let you know what was going on as you were reverting the majority of the edits from the IP. I finally managed to 'talk down ' the main vandal, but now another one has started following his example. There was at one point quite a large group vandalising EN, I don't want that to happen over here. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">Archer7</a> 17:22, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry about my lack of comments for my speedy delete of Type 1 Degenerative Super AIDS, it was an oversight, but on closer inspection the article was complete nonsense, most of which was offensive.</p>

<p>I think two admins here should get CheckUser status to combat the recent vandalism (see <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser" class="extiw" title="m:CheckUser">m:CheckUser</a>). We will need 25-30 editors to approve it (which could take a while but is achievable). What do you think?

<p>Also, I see you're up for checkuser here, and as one of the main checkusers on en.wiki, I wanted to offer any help you might need if the request succeeds. Checkuser is a difficult permission, and requires a lot of technical proficiency; it is far from the "pop in two usernames and get a big red 'sockpuppet' banner" that people tend to expect. It has quite a learning curve while you learn to identify hosting companies, open proxies, dynamic ips, ISPs that use proxy servers (like AOL), as well as learning about IP ranges, the operation of IPs in general, and so forth. If you have need of an experienced checker, I'm always available (although more quickly via my en.wiki talk page).</p>

<p>I just happened to be reading through Archer7's talk page before adding a comment to him there, and noticed your explanation of the RfD on that AIDS band. I wanted to mention that I strongly support how you dealt with that. You did your very best to be impartial and not to take matters into your own hands based on your own opinion, and instead took it to an RfD discussion, for good reasons.

<p>Hi - you may have noticed some problems with CommonsTicker lately - namely, some entries about deletions went missing, and some entries arrived several days late (messing up the date headings for ticker pages using append mode). This is caused by the massive replication lag we currently see on the toolserver (it's more than a day behind). While I hope this will not happen again in the future, I have been working on improving CommonsTicker so it handles out-of-sync entries gracefully.</p>
<p>I plan to activate a new version of CommonsTicker tonight or tomorrow - so look out for any new problems. Here are the most relevant changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>fix handling of out-of-sync records (see above); added "latecomer" parameter to TickerEntry template (may be ignored)</li>
<li>deleted images can be restored now. To reflect this, I have added a "restored" action to CommonsTicker. To use it, you need to change your templates and/or CSS <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADuesentrieb%2FCommonsTicker&amp;diff=377180&amp;oldid=377144" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADuesentrieb%2FCommonsTicker&amp;diff=377180&amp;oldid=377144" rel="nofollow">like this</a>.</li>
<li>for pages in append-mode, there an empty "status" parameter is now handed to the TickerEntry template - this parameter can be set manually to trigger some type of marking or highliting, depending on how you set up your template and CSS.

<p>For the future, I'm planning to let CommonsTicker post warnings to the talk page of articles that use an image das is (about to be) deleted. I'll post another announcement when that feature is ready.</p>

<p>I do take your commments constructively, and thanks for making them. While I could debate with you how many edits were policy-related and how many article-related, I think that would be a waste of time. I got the message. I did not notice how inflammatory my edits might seem, though I did realize that some of them were directly against Netoholic. Fortunately, very few of them seem to have upset him. You are right, though, I should be more careful/considerate when I can be. I just feel like one person's opinion should not stop progress. Should I mention those kinds of changes on Simple talk before making them, or perhaps ask one of you to make them if you think they are a good idea? What do you think? --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cromwellt_f6b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cromwellt">contribs</a> 07:17, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the ideas. Any thoughts on why Netoholic wants <a href="../../../c/o/r/Wikipedia%7ECore_article_258a.html" title="Wikipedia:Core article">Wikipedia:Core article</a> to be a permanent guideline?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do find it interesting (frustrating, actually) that no one else seems interested in making our policies better, etc. My first impulse would be to chalk it up to lack of initiative, though it is the kind of work most people don't want to do. I've always been the kind of person who likes doing the kinds of jobs no one else is interested in (cleanup, clerical stuff, etc.), and I've always liked working with/improving rules (not too many, not too complicated, but good ones). I'm the kind of guy that immediately wants to fix any lacks or problems he sees, and I like taking the initiative and <a href="../../../../en/b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" class="extiw" title="en:Wikipedia:Be_bold_in_updating_pages">being bold</a>. But I've always been the nice guy, which is why it surprises me when Netoholic paints me as a troublemaker. I can be unyielding regarding my principles, admittedly. I'd like to be the nice guy here, taking care of unwanted tasks, making this place better, but Netoholic won't let me. I would be <i>much</i> more active here if I didn't feel stymied by Netoholic, and that's the truth. And a significantly higher percentage of the time I spend here would be on articles if I weren't fighting his obstinacy in the face of logic and consensus. On SEWikt, my <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Cromwellt&amp;dbname=simplewiktionary_p" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Cromwellt&amp;dbname=simplewiktionary_p" rel="nofollow">edits</a> are mostly in the main namespace, and on <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Cromwellt&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Cromwellt&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" rel="nofollow">EWikipedia</a>, my my main namespace edits are 5/8 of my total. Wherever I go, I only change the project namespace when I see a lack (or typos, etc.). Sure, I might suggest some things, but I always respect the rules.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ironically, the major changes to policy in the past have been by Netoholic himself. Angela has imported some policies and simplified them, but hasn't changed anything, though she did discuss some differences long ago on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_79ff.html" title="Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not</a>. Netoholic has changed <i>many</i> policy and guideline pages to reflect his vision of the project, without asking for the input of others. Then he tells others that that's the way it is, based on the policy that he himself changed. Nice system, don't you think? One of the most obvious is <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">WP:WWIN</a>, where <i>all</i> of the major changes (new sections, etc.) are his work. Sure, he's worked here longer, but I don't need tenure to know a problem when I see one. Actually, Netoholic's edits to the Wikipedia: namespace (566 at last count) dwarf mine (186), though I admit that the ratio to total edits is much smaller in mine. Funny how he gets on my case for having more edits on the Wikipedia: namespace than in the main namespace, when he has more <i>deletes</i> than edits to the article namespace. While it is true that there is plenty of vandalism to undo, I'm sure that many of those things did not deserve deletion. Are we sure we want an admin (not to mention bureaucrat) who removes more than he contributes?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So it sounds like the best people to talk to would be you and Archer7 and Netoholic himself. Despite the fact that both you and Archer7 have made changes which are not directly changing policy, they are still closely related (and not article edits) and show obvious initiative in improving the way things work around here. Although Netoholic is a sort of hostile party in this, that might be advantageous in some ways: if I share an idea with him, and he rejects it (as he almost certainly will), then I can ask his reasons. As long as those reasons are not unreasonable or "simply unnecessary," like his opinion of undelete, I can fix those things in my proposal and try again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, while it is true that I have recently made edits that provoked Netoholic, have you noticed how many of his edits have been provocative toward me, ever since I came? Reverts (most without explanations), statements directly challenging me, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Special%7EDeletion_log_Netoholic_6875.html" title="Special:Deletion log/Netoholic">deletion</a> of my <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_policy_ab70.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy">work</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">ignoring</a> my comments and requests for discussion, and outright <a href="../../../s/i/m/Wikipedia%7ESimple_talk_51fd.html#Short_version_.28on_the_current_issue_Archer7.2FNetoholic.2FCromwellt.29_for_those_without_the_time_to_read" title="Wikipedia:Simple talk">name-calling</a>.</dd>

<p>Hello. A new version of CommonsTicker will be rolled out soon (probably tomorrow). Please have an eye on what the bot is doing, and report any problems to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Duesentrieb/CommonsTicker" class="extiw" title="m:User_talk:Duesentrieb/CommonsTicker">m:User_talk:Duesentrieb/CommonsTicker</a>. Some of the changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ticker can now post warnings to the talk page of articles that are using "endangered" images. This is not enabled per default, and you can select for which namespaces it is done. If you want this feature, please request it at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Duesentrieb/CommonsTicker#Change_Requests" class="extiw" title="m:User:Duesentrieb/CommonsTicker">m:User:Duesentrieb/CommonsTicker#Change_Requests</a>.</li>
<li>in append mode, there are now three empty template parameters: <tt>status</tt>, <tt>editor</tt>, and <tt>notic</tt>. The ticker does not use them itself, but you can use them in the TickerEntry template, for example to strike through entries that have been fixed. <a href="http://simple.wikinews.org/wiki/en:Wikinews:CommonsTicker" class="extiw" title="n:en:Wikinews:CommonsTicker">en:wikinews</a> has already been using this for a while now.</li>
<li>if the ticker fails to post an update, a warning is posted to your and the ticker's talk page. In append mode, the ticker will also re-try to post the update on the next pass. Until now, failed updates where simply ignored.</li>
<li>edit summaries become a bit more informative.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope these changes will help to make CommonsTicker more used and more useful.</p>
<p>On a related note: you may have noticed that on long pages, entries near the bottom of the page are sometimes not expanded but rendered just as {{TickerEntry}} or similar. This is due to a new limit to template expansion - see <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7005" class="extiw" title="bugzilla:7005">bugzilla:7005</a>. To avoid it, try to keep the page short and/or try to simplify the TickerEntry template.</p>

<p>﻿Hello</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, there have been some problems with CommonsTicker lately:</p>
<ul>
<li>first, the toolserver was down. After it was back up, we had to wait for fresh database dumps.</li>
<li>also, many updates where failing because ticker pages where growing too large. Updates that went through half-way somtimes also caused entries to be posted multiple times, making the problem worse.</li>
<li>when I tried to improve performance, I introduced a bug that caused the ticker to post trash sometimes. I disabled the ticker again when I was told about it, and I have fixed all effected pages yesterday (I hope I didn't miss any).</li>
</ul>
<p>To sort this out completely, I have to rewrite parts of CommonsTicker. For now, I will enable the ticker again for most wikis, but not for the ones that where having most trouble - namely de-wikipedia, en-wikinews, eo-wikipedia, es-wikipedia, fr-wikipedia, ja-wikipedia, ru-wikipedia, simple-wikipedia and zh-wikipedia. I'll have to investigate those more closely.</p>
<p>So please keep an eye on CommonsTicker in the next days - if there is any more trouble, please tell me, preferrably on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Duesentrieb/CommonsTicker" class="extiw" title="meta:User_talk:Duesentrieb/CommonsTicker">meta:User_talk:Duesentrieb/CommonsTicker</a>.</p>
