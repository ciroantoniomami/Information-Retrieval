It is set in the future, but also has many things about it which would be expected in a story of the American Old West. This combination of <a href="../../../p/a/s/Past.html" title="Past">past</a> and <a href="../../../f/u/t/Future.html" title="Future">future</a> gives a unique science fiction setting for the story.

He created it with his production <a href="../../../c/o/m/Company.html" title="Company">company</a>, Mutant Enemy. Whedon was the executive producer, along with Tim Minear.</p>
<p><i>Firefly</i> was first <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast.html" title="Broadcast">broadcast</a> on the <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">FOX</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_network.html" title="Television network">network</a>. It was cancelled after only eleven of the fourteen <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episode.html" title="Episode">episodes</a> were shown. Even though the show did not last long, it sold very well when it was released onto <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> and had great <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan.html" title="Fan">fan</a> <a href="../../../s/u/p/Support.html" title="Support">support</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-sfgate_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sfgate" title="">[2]</a></sup> Because of this, Whedon and Universal Pictures made a <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html" title="Film">movie</a> based on the series, titled <i><a href="../../../s/e/r/Serenity_%28film%29.html" title="Serenity (film)">Serenity</a></i>.

<p>The series is set in 2517 <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anno_Domini_11cb.html" title="Anno Domini">AD</a>. It follows the adventures of the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crew.html" title="Crew">crew</a> of <i>Serenity</i>, a <i>Firefly</i>-class spaceship. The cast play the nine characters who live on <i>Serenity</i>. Whedon described the show as "nine people looking into the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black.html" title="Black">blackness</a> of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space.html" title="Space">space</a> and seeing nine different things".<sup id="_ref-torontosun_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-torontosun" title="">[4]</a></sup> The show looks at the changing lives of people who fought on the losing side of a <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_war.html" title="Civil war">civil war</a>. It also shows the pioneer <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a> that is on the edges of their star system.

This government was called the <i>Alliance</i>. This also caused the two cultures to blend into each other. Whedon said that nothing has changed in the future.

<p>Whedon came up with the idea for the show after reading <i>The Killer Angels</i>, a <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> about the Battle of Gettysburg during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>.

He felt that the word "<a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly.html" title="Firefly">firefly</a>" had both. The fact that it was also something small with a powerful name made him like it more.

<p>While making the first episode, Whedon was arguing with FOX that the show should be shown in <a href="../../../w/i/d/Widescreen.html" title="Widescreen">widescreen format</a>. Because of this, he filmed scenes with <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">actors</a> on the edge of both sides so that they would have to show it that way.<sup id="_ref-pilotcommentary_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pilotcommentary" title="">[8]</a></sup> However, the pilot was turned down by the FOX executives. They thought that it did not have enough action. They also did not like the captain.<sup id="_ref-ttjc1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ttjc1" title="">[9]</a></sup> FOX told Whedon on a Friday afternoon that he had to make a new script by Monday morning or they would not do it.<sup id="_ref-ttjc1_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ttjc1" title="">[9]</a></sup> Whedon and Tim Minear spent the weekend writing a new episode, "The Train Job".<sup id="_ref-ttjc1_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ttjc1" title="">[9]</a></sup> In this new episode, the captain was more "happy" and they added "larger than life" characters.<sup id="_ref-ttjc1_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ttjc1" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ttjc7_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ttjc7" title="">[10]</a></sup> These characters were the henchman "Crow", and the "hands of blue" men, that also introduced a <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_X-Files_4e17.html" title="The X-Files">X-Files</a></i>-type ending.<sup id="_ref-ttjc7_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ttjc7" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>Production designer Carey Meyer built the ship <i>Serenity</i> in two parts. It was built as a complete set. It had ceilings and working lights built in as part of the set that the cameras could use. It also had movable parts.<sup id="_ref-ttjc3_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ttjc3" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-FFC11_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FFC11" title="">[12]</a></sup> This helped with moving the camera around inside the set. There were other good things about this set design. One was that it let the people watching feel that they were really in a ship.<sup id="_ref-ttjc3_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ttjc3" title="">[11]</a></sup> For Whedon, the design of the ship was very important. It defined the known space for the viewer. He wanted to show that it was simple and that it was "beat-up but lived-in and ultimately, it was home".<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[13]</a></sup> Each room had a feel to it, usually shown by the <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paint.html" title="Paint">paint</a> color.<sup id="_ref-FFC10_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FFC10" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Their small budget was a reason to use the ship for much of telling the story. When the characters did go off of the ship, the worlds all had <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atmosphere.html" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color.html" title="Color">colors</a>.

<p>The theme song, "The Ballad of Serenity", was written by Joss Whedon and performed by Sonny Rhodes. Whedon wrote the song before the series was approved by Fox. An early <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record.html" title="Record">recording</a> done by Whedon can be found on the DVD release. The soundtrack to the series was released on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_disc.html" title="Compact disc">CD</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_8.html" title="November 8">November 8</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> by VarÃ¨se Sarabande.

<p>In casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked first at the actor and how they got along with others. All nine cast members were chosen before filming began. However, while filming the original pilot "Serenity", Whedon saw that the actress cast as Inara Serra (Rebecca Gayheart) was not right for the role.Morena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show.</p>
<p>Whedon asked Nathan Fillion to play the lead role of Malcolm Reynolds. After telling him the idea for the show and showing him the pilot, Fillion wanted the role.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[15]</a></sup> Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast.</p>
<p>Alan Tudyk auditioned and was told to come back in to test with the possible Zoes (the character's wife). It was down to him and one other person. The Zoes did not work out and Tudyk was sent home. He got a call telling him he had the part anyway. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Veteran science fiction-<a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy.html" title="Fantasy">fantasy</a> actress Gina Torres (<i>The Matrix Reloaded</i>, <i>Xena: Warrior Princess</i>) did not at first want to do another science fiction show, but "was won over by the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quality.html" title="Quality">quality</a> of the source material."<sup id="_ref-FFC40_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FFC40" title="">[17]</a></sup> As she recalled, "So you had these challenged characters inhabiting a challenging world and that makes for great storytelling. AND NO ALIENS!"<sup id="_ref-FFC40_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FFC40" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Adam Baldwin grew up watching westerns. The character of Jayne Cobb was a role that was perfect for him.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> actress Jewel Staite has been an actress since age nine. She videotaped her audition from <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. she was asked to come to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> to meet Whedon, where she was cast for the role of Kaylee Frye, the ship's <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineer.html" title="Engineer">engineer</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sean Maher remembers reading for the part and liking the character of Simon Tam. He said it was Whedon's personality and vision that "sealed the deal" for him. For the role of Simon's sister, Whedon called in <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Glau_1169.html" title="Summer Glau">Summer Glau</a> for an audition and test the same day. Glau had first worked for Whedon on an episode of <i>Angel</i>. Two weeks later Whedon called her to tell her she had the part. This was Glau's first speaking role.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>The veteran television actor Ron Glass (<i>Barney Miller</i>, <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_in_the_Family_80eb.html" title="All in the Family">All in the Family</a></i>), has said that until <i>Firefly</i>, he had not thought about a science-fiction western role but he fell in love with the pilot script and the character of Shepherd Book.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p>The series takes place in the year 2517, on several <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet.html" title="Planet">planets</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">moons</a>. The TV series does not say if these are in one star system. The film <i>Serenity</i> makes clear that all the planets and moons are in one large system. The characters refer to "Earth-that-was" and in the film, it is said that long before the events in the series a large population had left from <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> to a new star system: "Earth that was could no longer sustain our numbers, we were so many." The people settled in this new star system, with "dozens of planets and hundreds of moons." Many of these were terraformed, a process in which a planet or moon is altered to resemble the Earth. The terraforming process was only the first step in making a planet livable. Only the most central planets got more treatment. This caused many of the border planets and moons to have environmentsthat fit the Western setting.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly_%28TV_series%29_5a5c.html" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Synopsis</span></h3>
<p>The show takes its name from the <i>Firefly</i>-class spaceship <i>Serenity</i> that the main characters call home. It looks like the <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly.html" title="Firefly">lightning bug, Firefly</a> in shape. Its tail section even lights up during <a href="../../../a/c/c/Acceleration.html" title="Acceleration">acceleration</a>.</p>
<p>The Alliance is shown to control the star system through an <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organization.html" title="Organization">organization</a> of "core" planets. DVD commentary suggests that two main "core" planets make up the Alliance. One is mostly Occidental in culture, the other is Asian. This explains the series' mixed <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">linguistic</a> and visual themes. The central planets are under Alliance control, but the outer planets and moons resemble the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> American West, with little government control. Settlers people on the outer worlds have <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relative.html" title="Relative">relative</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom.html" title="Freedom">freedom</a> from the central government. The outer areas also have Reavers, a cannibalistic <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a>.</p>
<p>The captain of the crew of <i>Serenity</i> is Malcolm "Mal" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion). The episode "Serenity" shows that the captain and his first mate Zoe Washburne (Gina Torres) are veteran "Browncoats" of the civil war. A later episode, titled "Out of Gas", shows that Mal bought the spaceship <i>Serenity</i> to continue living beyond Alliance control. Much of the crew's work is made up of cargo runs or smuggling. One of the main story arcs is that of River Tam (<a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Glau_1169.html" title="Summer Glau">Summer Glau</a>) and her brother Simon (Sean Maher). River was a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_prodigy.html" title="Child prodigy">child prodigy</a>. Her <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain.html" title="Brain">brain</a> was <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experiment.html" title="Experiment">experimented</a> on. She seems to have <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schizophrenia.html" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> and often hears voices. It is later found out that she is a "reader", someone who psychic abilities. Simon gave up a very good <a href="../../../c/a/r/Career.html" title="Career">career</a> as a surgeon to save her from the Alliance. They join the crew in the original "Serenity". Because of this rescue, they are both wanted <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminal.html" title="Criminal">criminals</a>.</p>

<p><i>Firefly</i> takes place in a multi-cultural future. Because of this, Mandarin Chinese is a common second language. It is used in <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertisement.html" title="Advertisement">advertisements</a>, and characters in the show often use Chinese words and <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse.html" title="Curse">curses</a>.</p>
<p>The show also has <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a> not used in today's culture. There are changes to modern words, or new words ("shiny" is a <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synonym.html" title="Synonym">synonym</a> of "cool"). The <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_language.html" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a> and an Old West <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a> are also used.</p>
<p>One of the problems that Whedon had with FOX was the tone of the show, especially with the main character Malcolm Reynolds. FOX wanted Whedon to make his character more "jolly". They felt he was too dark in the original pilot.</p>

<p><i>Firefly</i> had an ensemble cast that played the nine crew members of the ship, <i>Serenity</i>. These characters fight criminals, Alliance <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">security forces</a>, the insane Reavers, and the mysterious men with "hands of blue" - who seem to work for a secret agency which is part of the huge <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporation.html" title="Corporation">corporation</a>, The Blue Sun Corporation. The crew needs to get enough <a href="../../../i/n/c/Income.html" title="Income">income</a> to keep their ship working. While doing this, they must stay hidden from people looking for them.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Malcolm "Mal" Reynolds</b>, played by Nathan Fillion, is <i>Serenity</i>'s captain and former sergeant in the <i>Battle of Serenity Valley</i> during the war.</li>

<li><b>Inara Serra</b>, played by Morena Baccarin, is a "Companion". A companion is the 26th <a href="../../../c/e/n/Century.html" title="Century">century</a> version of a courtesan or geisha. Inara has high <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social.html" title="Social">social</a> position. She and Mal have a hard relationship, with <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance.html" title="Romance">romantic</a> <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tension.html" title="Tension">tension</a> playing a big part in several episodes.</li>
<li><b>Jayne Cobb</b>, played by Adam Baldwin, is the hired <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscle.html" title="Muscle">muscle</a>. He joined the crew for mercenary reasons. He is often the "main gun" for jobs and is someone that can be counted on in a fight.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[22]</a></sup> He thinks he is the smartest guy in space but he is just the <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposite.html" title="Opposite">opposite</a>. As Whedon says several times, he is the person that will ask the questions that no one else wants to talk about.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[23]</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Kaywinnit Lee "Kaylee" Frye</b>, played by Jewel Staite, is the ship's mechanic. In the episode "Out of Gas", it is shown that she has no formal <a href="../../../t/r/a/Train.html" title="Train">training</a>. She keeps <i>Serenity</i> running with an intuitive <a href="../../../g/i/f/Gift.html" title="Gift">gift</a> for the workings of mechanical <a href="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/equipment" class="extiw" title="wikt:equipment">equipment</a>. A very happy young woman, Kaylee has a romantic crush on Dr. Simon Tam. Kaylee's character is the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a> of the ship: according to Joss Whedon, if Kaylee believes something, it is true.<sup id="_ref-pilotcommentary_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pilotcommentary" title="">[8]</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Dr. Simon Tam</b>, played by Sean Maher, is a very good <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor.html" title="Doctor">doctor</a>.

<li><b>River Tam</b>, played by <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Glau_1169.html" title="Summer Glau">Summer Glau</a>, was smuggled onto the ship by her brother. River was a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_prodigy.html" title="Child prodigy">child prodigy</a> of unmatched genius. She was experimented on by Alliance doctors. This made her <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delusion.html" title="Delusion">delusional</a>. It also caused her to act very strangely. Her trying to figure out what became of her is a theme shown throughout the series and the movie.</li>
<li><b>Derrial Book</b>, played by Ron Glass, is a "Shepherd" (much like of a reverend, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister.html" title="Minister">minister</a> or pastor). In the episode "Safe", it is shown that he has very high status in the Alliance but it is never said why. Throughout the series, he shows an unusual <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge.html" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> about firearms and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">criminal activities</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All nine major characters are in every episode, with one exception: Book is absent from "Ariel".</p>
