<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reri Horlockon sockpuppet</span></h2>
<p>Reri Horlockon's account has recently been a lot of trouble. Basically, he kept being attacked by a vandal operating from a dynamic IP range creating hundreds of sockpuppets. On a closer look, I realised that they all happened when Reri was online, and stopped when he went off. Then the 'good' account started to vandalise as well, so we blocked that too. He has recently come back under <a href="../../../m/i/a/User%7EMiagop_2aea.html" title="User:Miagop">User:Miagop</a> and claimed that he had an obvious password and that his account was hacked by the vandal. He then became rather aggressive when I left him waiting. I unblocked him to see what would happen, and within ten minutes of him coming online, <a href="../../../r/e/r/User%7EReri_Horlockon_is_a_loser_e933.html" title="User:Reri Horlockon is a loser">User:Reri Horlockon is a loser</a> appeared. We had none of this while the account was blocked, and a vandal can't have watched us 24/7 for the last month.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/i/a/User%7EMiagop_2aea.html" title="User:Miagop">User:Miagop</a> operated while the IP range was blocked. As there is a lot of evidence to say that Reri and the vandal are the same person, I think he must know how to evade blocks. So, I don't really know what I could do with CheckUser results on this one.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any ideas about what could have happened, it's rather confusing for everyone. <i><a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">Archer7</a> - <a href="../../../a/r/c/User_talk%7EArcher7_d9a3.html" title="User talk:Archer7">talk</a></i> 10:01, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing out the specific portions of the Psychiatry Article were not in simple enough English. I knew the article needed me to simplify, but sometimes one needs to sleep. I didn't realize you weren't allowed to upload anything until it was in finished form.</p>
<p>Some questions regarding notations you made in the edit history - <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Psychiatry&amp;diff=190384&amp;oldid=189944" class="external text" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Psychiatry&amp;diff=190384&amp;oldid=189944" rel="nofollow">Psychiatry History:Diff</a></p>
<p>1) Why did you remove the questions? Can I put them back if they are declarative topic headers rather than in the form of questions? There was not more added yet, but I put them in so I (and others) would have an outline to work from.</p>
<p>2) You said, "Possible copyvio in questions." How, exactly, could they constitute a copyright violation?</p>
<p>3) You made a notation that you moved certain deleted portions of the article to Psychology --- but when I checked the page &amp; history, that was not done. What am I to make of that?</p>
<p>Thank you again. I am glad someone stopped by to take a look at my beginning efforts of my first Simple Wiki article. --<a href="../../../k/i/w/User%7EKiwi_f11e.html" title="User:Kiwi">I am Kiwi</a> 06:47, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Tdxiang, Thank you so much for such a speedy reply. Thank you for clearing up my confusions. I appreciate your willingness to communicate with me, and to help me understand certain issues. I am brand new - this is the very first article I have ever tackled and I know I have much to learn if I am to become a good continuing editor through the years.</p>
<p>The questions, I realized this evening, reflect my years of teaching and my construction of lesson outline points and the way I would lead into discussions. People always know I have been a teacher as soon as they meet me and talk to me for just a short while. Terrible, eh? Forgive me.&#160;:o)--<a href="../../../k/i/w/User%7EKiwi_f11e.html" title="User:Kiwi">I am Kiwi</a> 07:19, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

It is only necessary to list here under unusual circumstances. Tagging for deletion is sufficient

<p>Nope, you don't need it to be unanimous. Just enough votes to show that the community wants you. Then, if the bureaucrat has any massive concerns, he can choose to postpone it for a bit until issues are resolved. It doesn't really come down to number of votes, so long as you have a few of them and the majority are 'supports'.

Do not fight with vandals. It is OK if an article sits vandalised for a short time. You should be spending your time trying to <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html#List_of_administrators" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">email admins</a> rather than fighting with the vandal. Someone looking to become an admin should know this procedure, because it is documented on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html#How_to_fight_vandalism" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism#How to fight vandalism</a>.

<dd>Netoholic, it does not say in Wikipedia:Vandalism to not war with vandals. Instead, it just says to report them to administrators. Besides, if an administrator is on the way, what is the harm in fighting vandalism? <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">PullToOp</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">n</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">Talk</a></sup> 00:06, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fighting back and forth with vandals only encourages them. They are children that want attention.

Tdxiang did not stop the user(s) with his 10 reverts... it was the admin blocking the user that did it. In this case, it was not even "pure" vandalism - the edits were porbably not correct (they were expressing their POV), but not totally destructive. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 00:50, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He'll be back on another day with another new account. Just ignore anybody who trolls me. Chances are, it's the same person. He's been at it for about a month. He seems to want the attention. Maybe that way, he'll stop making vandal/troll accounts here in Simple WP, or at the least perhaps move on to another user. Preferably the first option though.</dd>

<p>If you mark a page for deletion, please just add the {{delete|reason}} tag at the top, so an admin can more easily see the content you want deleted.

<p>Sorry if my oppose vote kept you from becoming an admin, but I try to make my admin standards here close to my EN standards. I guess I'm just one of the hard ones to please. ^_^ Give it a while and I won't oppose and some more and you'll have my support. Show that you're knowledgable of policy and guidelines, have the best interests of the project at heart, and that you're a role model when it comes to conduct. Sooner or later, I'm quite sure that you'll be unopposed.
