<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Proms_5d0b.html" title="Edit section: Why are they called “Proms”?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Why are they called “Proms”?</span></h2>
<p>The Proms started more than 100 years ago, in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a>. Concerts were expensive in those days, and not many people had enough <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">money</a> to go and hear good music. Most people were only able to hear good music when they went for walks in the London parks. <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orchestra.html" title="Orchestra">orchestras</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Band.html" title="Band">bands</a> played in bandstands. Most of the music was popular and easy to listen to. People could enjoy the music while they walked about.</p>
<p>In the centre of London there was a building called the “Queen’s Hall”. A man called Robert Newman organized concerts there. He had an idea. He wanted to start a series of concerts which ordinary people (people who were not rich) could afford to go to. He wanted to start a series of “promenade concerts” (in French “se promener” means “to walk”). The idea was that people could have standing places which would not cost much money. There would also be seats for people who could afford to pay more.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Proms_5d0b.html" title="Edit section: The early years of the Proms">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The early years of the Proms</span></h2>
<p>Robert Newman knew a very good young <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conductor.html" title="Conductor">conductor</a>, Henry Wood. He asked him to be the conductor of the Proms. A man called Dr Cathcart gave them enough money to get an orchestra together. On 10 August <a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a> the first Promenade Concert took place in the Queen’s Hall. The price of a promenade ticket (a ticket for a standing place) was one <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_pound.html" title="British pound">shilling</a>. In modern English money that is 5p.</p>
<p>The Promenade Concerts were a big success. Henry Wood conducted lots of popular music, but he also conducted music by great composers such as <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozart.html" title="Mozart">Mozart</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beethoven.html" title="Beethoven">Beethoven</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Mendelssohn_c1e5.html" title="Felix Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a>, <a href="../../../p/y/o/Pyotr_Tchaikovsky_7289.html" title="Pyotr Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannes_Brahms_a544.html" title="Johannes Brahms">Brahms</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Wagner_c988.html" title="Richard Wagner">Wagner</a>. People got used to listening to this music and slowly their musical tastes became better so that they could listen to longer pieces of music. Henry Wood’s orchestra played a lot of music by English composers. This helped English music to become better known. Some composers like Wallace and Cowan were popular then, but nowadays people have hardly heard of them. Other English composers like <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Elgar_2c78.html" title="Edward Elgar">Elgar</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Delius_d5eb.html" title="Frederick Delius">Delius</a> became very famous, and Wood helped them by performing their music and making it better known.</p>
<p>Wood liked the music of Wagner very much and often conducted it. Wagner was a <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> composer. In those days most famous conductors and singers were not <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a>. They came from <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, mostly from Germany. The Germans said that England was the “Land without Music”. They thought that the English were unmusical. It is true that in the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> (from <a href="../../../1/8/0/1801.html" title="1801">1801</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>) there were far more German musicians than English ones. But English music was getting better. Henry Wood showed that English conductors were just as good as foreign ones at conducting music by Wagner and other German composers.</p>
<p>Some of the music Wood conducted was very new music indeed. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a> he conducted a piece called “Five Orchestral Pieces” by an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a> composer <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schoenberg_ee5c.html" title="Arnold Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>). Schoenberg’s music sounded very modern and strange and the audience did not like it, so they hissed instead of clapping. Wood kept performing it at Promenade concerts until they got used to it. He even invited Schoenberg to come to England and conduct it himself in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>. This time the audience clapped.</p>
<p>Henry Wood conducted the Proms for fifty years, until just before his death in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>. Most of that time he was the only conductor, conducting every Prom. He helped the orchestras to play better. He rehearsed them very carefully (a “rehearsal” is when they practise for a concert). In those days there was a deputy system. A “deputy” is someone who plays instead of another player if they are not free. If a member of the orchestra could earn more money one night by playing somewhere else, he/she would ask a friend to go and play in Wood’s orchestra for that rehearsal or concert. At one rehearsal in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a> Wood looked at the orchestra and they were all deputies! He did not know any of them! So he stopped the deputy system. The players were very cross, and forty of them left the orchestra and formed their own orchestra: the London Symphony Orchestra. That orchestra is still famous today.</p>
<p>Wood was the first English conductor to allow women to play in orchestras. That was in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a> the Proms did not have enough money to continue so the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> (British Broadcasting Corporation) started to fund them (give them money). The Proms were broadcast on the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a>. The radio was quite a new invention then (people called it the “wireless”). At first people said “If you put concerts on the wireless, people will just sit at home to listen to music and no one will bother to go to concerts any more”. But the people who said that were wrong. Hearing music on the radio made people more interested in going to concerts. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a> the BBC Symphony Orchestra was formed. From then onwards they were the orchestra who played at the Proms.</p>

The Proms continued to take place in the Royal Albert Hall. Then it became too dangerous in London and the Proms were held in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> and then <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedford_%28England%29_80ae.html" title="Bedford (England)">Bedford</a>. After the War the Proms went back to the Royal Albert Hall. They have been held there ever since. From the 1940s to the late 1960s the BBC Symphony Orchestra played at most of the concerts under the very popular conductor Sir Malcolm Sargent whose Last Night speeches became legendary for their wit.</p>

<p>Today the Proms are very different from when they started. It is much more <a href="../../../i/n/t/International.html" title="International">international</a>. The BBC Symphony Orchestra play several concerts each season but there are lots of other orchestras from all over the world who come to play.

<p>There is a Prom every night (i.e. every evening) for two months during the summer. The last concert is called the “Last Night of the Proms”. It is very famous and millions of people can watch it on <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> in lots of countries all over the world. Some people who go to the Last Night dress up in funny clothes and wave flags. They hear a piece of music based on sailors' sea shanties including a 'hornpipe' , a dance that gets faster and faster and which they try to clap to in time. (They always lose!) They sing famous songs about England: “Rule Britannia”, “Land of Hope and Glory” and “Jerusalem”. The conductor makes a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speech.html" title="Speech">speech</a>.</p>

<p>One way to go to the Proms is to buy a ticket for a seat, just like any other sort of concert. But many people think the best way to go to the Proms is to be a promenader. This means having a standing place. There are two places to prom: downstairs in the arena and upstairs in the gallery. The Royal Albert Hall is round, and looks like an old <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphitheatre.html" title="Amphitheatre">amphitheatre</a>. That is why the floor downstairs is called the “arena”, like in an amphitheatre. The promenaders who stand downstairs are near the orchestra, especially the front rows. But it can be quite a squash when there are lots of people, and small children need to be near the front to see properly. The other place to promenade is upstairs in the gallery. There is more room there, and it is easy to see, and easy to sit down or even lie down when one feels tired.</p>
<p>A ticket to promenade costs £5. People who want to be a promenader have to wait in a <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queue.html" title="Queue">queue</a> outside and buy their ticket as they go in. Anyone who wants to be near the front should join the queue early, especially for the very popular concerts, and at the weekend. Some people queue for hours. They pass the time by talking to one another, reading or playing games. It is all good fun and part of enjoying being at the Proms.</p>
