<p><i>The Lord of the Rings</i> began as a <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequel.html" title="Sequel">sequel</a> to Tolkien's earlier fantasy book, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hobbit_6754.html" title="The Hobbit">The Hobbit</a></i>, but quickly became a much larger story. He also moved its (and <i>The Hobbit'</i>s) story into his fictional world <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-earth.html" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>, which he had already invented long before he wrote <i>The Hobbit</i>. Tolkien wrote the story between 1937 and 1949. It was originally <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publish.html" title="Publish">published</a> in three parts in the years 1954 and 1955. Since then, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> has been translated into 38 languages. It is one of the most popular stories in 20th-century <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literature.html" title="Literature">literature</a> and has been an important book for the fantasy <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">genre</a>.</p>
<p><i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is often wrongly called a <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trilogy.html" title="Trilogy">trilogy</a>, because the publisher split the book into three parts because of the book's size. Tolkien himself had sub-divided the <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> into six parts, called Book I-VI, according to the plot. Tolkien never liked it being published in three parts or called a trilogy.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="Edit section: Backstory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Backstory</span></h2>
<p>The backstory of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> begins thousands of years before the action in the book.</p>
<p>In the Second Age, Dark Lord <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauron.html" title="Sauron">Sauron</a> wanted to rule Middle-earth. He disguised himself as Annatar, the <i>Lord of Gifts</i>, and pretended to be good. As Annatar he told the elves how to make magical rings which give power to their wearers. Sauron and the elves together made sixteen rings. The Elves also made three rings by themselves. These nineteen rings were the <i>Rings of Power</i>. But Sauron secretly forged a Great Ring of his own, the <i>One Ring</i>. In this Ring Sauron put half of his power. He planned to control the wearers of the other rings with this One Ring. But the Elves finally realized that Annatar really was the evil Sauron and hid the Rings of Power.</p>
<p>Sauron then started a war. During this war he took back the sixteen rings which he had made together with the Elves. Seven of these rings he gave to the kings of the dwarves, and nine rings he gave to human kings. These human kings became the <i><a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazg%C3%BBl.html" title="Nazgûl">Nazgûl</a></i>, the Ringwraiths, ghostly servants of Sauron.</p>
<p>The Elves and the Men of Gondor and Anor formed the <i>Last Alliance of Men and Elves</i> to fight Sauron. There was a long war and siege of Sauron's fortress. In one battle, Isildur, the son of the King of Men, cut off the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Sauron was defeated and the war ended.</p>
<p>Because half of Sauron's power was in the One Ring, Sauron did not die fully. His spirit still existed as long as the Ring existed. The elves told Isildur to destroy the One Ring, but Isildur did not want to and kept it.</p>
<p>The One Ring was lost when Isildur was killed. In the Third Age, the Ring was found by Gollum, who had it for five hundred years. In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hobbit_6754.html" title="The Hobbit">The Hobbit</a></i> the Ring is found by the <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobbit.html" title="Hobbit">hobbit</a> <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilbo_Baggins_7146.html" title="Bilbo Baggins">Bilbo Baggins</a>. He thinks it is an unimportant 'magic ring' that simply makes its wearer invisible. Bilbo keeps it, and brings it back with him to the Shire at the end of his journey. There the One Ring stayed until the beginning of the <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.</p>

<p>The book begins in the Third Age of <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-earth.html" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>, in the Shire, the land of the <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobbit.html" title="Hobbit">hobbits</a>. Sixty years after his adventures in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hobbit_6754.html" title="The Hobbit">The Hobbit</a></i>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilbo_Baggins_7146.html" title="Bilbo Baggins">Bilbo Baggins</a> is living in the Shire with his adopted cousin <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frodo_Baggins_d8a3.html" title="Frodo Baggins">Frodo Baggins</a>. But Bilbo wants to make another long journey. After a birthday party for his 111th birthday, and Frodo's 33rd birthday, Bilbo leaves the Shire. His home, Bag End, and the One Ring now belong to Frodo. For another eighteen years nothing happens in Frodo's life.</p>
<p>In April of the year 3018, <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandalf.html" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a> the Grey, the wizard friend of Bilbo and Frodo, comes to Bag End. He tells Frodo that his 'magic ring' is really the One Ring of <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauron.html" title="Sauron">Sauron</a>, and tells him its backstory. Sauron is returning and getting more powerful, because he could not die while the Ring still existed. Sauron is now also searching for the Ring. Gandalf tells Frodo that he has to leave the Shire and take the One Ring to Rivendell, an elven city. <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samwise_Gamgee_7677.html" title="Samwise Gamgee">Samwise Gamgee</a>, Frodo's gardener and servant, will go with Frodo. Gandalf promises to meet the two hobbits halfway in the town Bree. Then Gandalf leaves.</p>
<p>Frodo and Sam prepare to leave the Shire in September. On their way to leave the Shire they are already followed by Sauron's <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringwraith.html" title="Ringwraith">Ringwraiths</a>. Frodo's cousins, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meriadoc_Brandybuck_451c.html" title="Meriadoc Brandybuck">Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peregrin_Took_9f8c.html" title="Peregrin Took">Peregrin "Pippin" Took</a> also come with them. The four hobbits journey eastwards through the <i>Old Forest</i>, over the <i>Barrow-downs</i>. They come to Bree, but Gandalf is not there. They meet a man named Strider, and they get a letter from Gandalf. In the letter they are told to go with Strider, who is really named Aragorn.</p>
<p>The hobbits continue their journey to Rivendell with Aragorn. On the mountain Weathertop they are attacked by the Ringwraiths, and Frodo is badly wounded. Aragorn can defend them, and help Frodo to stay alive. Along the way they meet the elf Glorfindel. Shortly before Rivendell they are attacked again. Frodo can flee on Glorfindel's horse, followed by the Ringwraiths. Frodo crosses the river Bruinen, beyond which is Rivendell, but the Ringwraiths still follow him. Suddenly the river floods, the water carrying the Ringwraiths away. Frodo falls unconcious.</p>

<p>Frodo wakes up in Rivendell. He has been healed by the elven lord Elrond, and Frodo's friends are also well. <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandalf.html" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a> is in Rivendell, as are messengers from other peoples. Frodo also meets Bilbo again, who has lived in Rivendell for the past years.</p>
<p>The next day the <i>Council of Elrond</i> is held. The messengers of the different peoples all tell the stories why they have come, which are connected to Sauron's doings. Elrond tells them of Sauron and the One Ring. Many other things are told and revealed. Aragorn is the descendant of Isildur. The wizard <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saruman.html" title="Saruman">Saruman</a> has betrayed the free peoples and turned to evil. Also, the One Ring cannot be used by anyone except Sauron. The One Ring turns normal people invisible, but it also corrupts them, makes its wearer power-hungry, and the ring only does evil. The Council decides that the One Ring has to be destroyed, which will also truly kill Sauron forever. But the One Ring can only be destroyed if it is thrown into the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volcano.html" title="Volcano">volcano</a> Mount Doom in Sauron's land Mordor, where the One Ring was made. The Council sends Frodo, the Ring-bearer, to destroy the Ring, and eight companions to help him. These nine people are the <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i>: the four hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, the elf <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legolas.html" title="Legolas">Legolas</a>, the dwarf <a href="../../../g/i/m/Gimli_son_of_Gl%C3%B3in_5d87.html" title="Gimli son of Glóin">Gimli</a>, the two men Aragorn and <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boromir.html" title="Boromir">Boromir</a>, and Gandalf the Grey.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year 3019 the Fellowship begins their long journey. Before they go, Bilbo gives his sword <i>Sting</i> and his <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mithril.html" title="Mithril">Mithril</a>-armour to Frodo. With Gandalf as their leader, the Fellowship first goes southwards through the land <i>Hollin</i>. They try to go east over the Misty Mountains through the <i>Redhorn Pass</i>, but there is too much snow. The Fellowship decides to go under the mountains, through the old Dwarven mines, which are called Khazad-dûm or Moria. They almost manage to go through Moria without anything happening, but near the end they are attacked by Orcs. There is also a Balrog, a demonic evil creature from the First Age. Gandalf protects the Fellowship, but he and the Balrog fall into an abyss. Aragorn leads the rest of the Fellowship out of Moria.</p>
<p>Now east of the Misty Mountains, the remaining Fellowship comes to the forest Lothlórien, the land of the Galadhrim, a wood-elven people. The Fellowship is welcomed by Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn, the rulers of Lothlórien. The Fellowship stay for a while. When the Fellowship leaves Lóthlórien, the elves give them boats with which they can travel down the river Anduin. Each member of the Fellowship also gets a present from Lady Galadriel.</p>
<p>The Fellowship travel down the river Anduin until the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterfall.html" title="Waterfall">waterfall</a> Rauros. There they stop to decide where to go now: south to Boromir's home city Minas Tirith, or east to Mordor. Frodo goes for a walk to help him decide. He meets Boromir, who says that the Fellowship should go to Minas Tirith. Boromir also begins to talk about using the Ring against Sauron. Frodo realizes that Boromir is influenced by the One Ring. Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, but Frodo puts the Ring on, becomes invisible and escapes. Boromir becomes himself again and is very sorry for what he tried to do. Frodo decides that he will go alone to Mordor, so that the Ring cannot influence or hurt anyone else. The rest of the Fellowship are worrying where Frodo is. When Boromir comes and tells them that Frodo has run away, all of the Fellowship go and search for him. Sam thinks about the situation, and realizes that Frodo wants to go to Mordor alone. Sam runs back to the boats, and catches Frodo leaving. In the end Frodo and Sam go east to Mordor together, to destroy the One Ring, and hoping that their friends in the Fellowship will be well.</p>

<p>The book begins with Aragorn, who finds a dieing Boromir. Boromir tells him that they were attacked by Orcs, who took Merry and Pippin with them. Boromir says he is sorry for everything and dies. Legolas and Gimli arrive. As a <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funeral.html" title="Funeral">funeral</a>, the three put Boromirs body in one of their boats, which they let fall down the waterfall Rauros. They find out that Frodo and Sam left them to go to Mordor, and that the Orcs that attacked them were <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saruman.html" title="Saruman">Saruman</a>'s Orcs, who have taken Merry and Pippin. They decide to follow the Orcs westwards to save Merry and Pippin. West of the Emyn Muil they come into the land Rohan, home of the Rohirrim, the <i>Horse-lords</i>. They meet a group of Rohirrim led by <a href="../../../%C3%A9/o/m/%C3%89omer.html" title="Éomer">Éomer</a>, nephew of King <a href="../../../t/h/%C3%A9/Th%C3%A9oden.html" title="Théoden">Théoden</a> of Rohan. Éomer and his men have killed the Orc group on the border of the forest Fangorn, but did not see Merry or Pippin. Éomer gives them two horses, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli ride to the Fangorn forest.</p>
<p>Merry and Pippin were caught and taken away by a group of Saruman's Orcs, the Uruk-hai. When the Orcs are killed by the Rohirrim group, the two hobbits can escape into the Fangorn forest. There they meet Treebeard, an Ent. Ents are giants tree-like beings. Treebeard takes the hobbits with him, and they tell him what happens in the world outside Fangorn. The Ents have a meeting, the <i>Entmoot</i>. During the <i>Entmoot</i> the Ents decide to fight Saruman. Treebeard, the othe Ents, and the two hobbits go to Isengard, Saruman's home.</p>
<p>In Fangorn Aragon, Legolas and Gimli meet Gandalf. He had died, but was sent back to Middle-earth as Gandalf the White, to further help the fight against Sauron. Gandalf tells them that Merry and Pippin are well. They then go to Edoras, the capital of Rohan. Gandalf tells King Théoden that they have to go to war against Saruman. Gríma Wormtongue, a spy and servant of Saruman, ist cast out. The people of Edoras, led by Éomer's sister <a href="../../../%C3%A9/o/w/%C3%89owyn.html" title="Éowyn">Éowyn</a>, flee to Dunharrow in the White Mountains, while the army of the Rohirrim goes to the fortress Helm's Deep. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli go with the Rohirrim warriors, but Gandalf leaves once more. Saruman sends his army of ten thousand Uruk-hai, Orcs, and Dunland men to Helm's Klamm. The next morning Gandalf arrives with another Rohirrim army. They can defeat Saruman's army, and win the <i>Battle of the Hornburg</i>.</p>
<p>Gandalf, his friends, and a small group of Rohirrim then go to Isengard, Saruman's home. But when they arrive it has already been destroyed by the Ents. They also meet Merry and Pippin there. They talk to Saruman, who still hides in his undestructible tower Orthanc. Gandalf cast him from the Order of Wizards. They find the palantír, which was thrown from the tower by Gríma. The Palantíri are magical black stones with which one can see far away things, and communicate with other palantíri. The group leaves Isengard and rests. Pippin steals the palantír and looks in, and because of this is discovered by Sauron. The group flees the place before the Nazgûl find them. Gandalf and Pippin go to Minas Tirith. The Rohirrim and other members of the fellowship go back to Helm's Deep.</p>

<p>Frodo and Sam journey eastwards to Mordor. In the Emyn Muil mountains they are attacked by Gollum. Gollum has to promise to show them the way into Mordor. They go through the Dead Marshes and come to the Morannon, the Black Gate of Mordor. They cannot go in, but Gollum says he knows a secret way into Mordor. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum travel south through Ithilien. There they see a battle between a group of Southrons and a group of Rangers of Gondor. The hobbits are caught by the Gondorian group, which is led by <a href="../../../f/a/r/Faramir.html" title="Faramir">Faramir</a>, who is Boromir's brother. But the next day Faramir lets the hobbits leave, because he also believes that the One Ring has to be destroyed. Gollum leads the hobbits into Cirith Ungol, but leaves the hobbits there alone. They are hunted by <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelob.html" title="Shelob">Shelob</a>, a giant spider living in these tunnels. Shelob stings Frodo, but is wounded and driven off by Sam. Sam believes Frodo is dead, and takes the Ring to continue and destroy it. Frodo's body is found and taken away by a group of Orcs. Sam follows them. The leaders of the Orc group are talking, and Sam hears them say that Frodo is still alive.</p>

The journeys of the members of the Fellowship during <i>RotK</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandalf.html" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a> and Pippin arrive in Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor. There they meet <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denethor.html" title="Denethor">Denethor II</a>, Steward of Gondor, and father of Boromir and Faramir. Pippin becomes a member of the <i>Guards of the Citadel</i>. Minas Tirith prepares for war.</p>
<p>The Rohirrim and Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Merry are on their way to Helm's Deep. Along the way they meet the <i>Grey Company</i> coming from Rivendell. It is a group of thirty Dúnedain, which are Aragorn's people. With the group are also Elladan and Elrohir, the sons of Elrond. Aragorn uses the palantír. Aragorn decides to take to the <i>Paths of the Dead</i>. Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and the Grey Company go to Edoras, Dunharrow, and through the <i>Paths of the Dead</i> through the White Mountains. There Aragorn calls an army of dead spirits to help him. The Grey Company and the <i>Dead Men of Dunharrow</i> then go east.</p>
<p>The Rohirrim and Merry come to Dunharrow. King Théoden takes the Rohirrim armies and goes to help Gondor in the war. Merry is not allowed to go with them, but he secretly goes with a warrior named Dernhelm.</p>
<p>In Minas Tirith they meet Faramir, who tells them of his meeting with Frodo. The next day Faramir goes off to defend the old city Osgiliath, but during the retreat Faramir is wounded. Minas Tirith is be<a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege.html" title="Siege">sieged</a> by the armies of Mordor, led by the <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch-king_of_Angmar_6446.html" title="Witch-king of Angmar">Witch-king</a>, the leader of the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazg%C3%BBl.html" title="Nazgûl">Nazgûl</a>. Denethor goes <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insanity.html" title="Insanity">insane</a> and kills himself, and almost also kills the sick Faramir, but this is prevented by Pippin and Gandalf.</p>
<p>Aragorn heals the wounded Faramir, Éowyn, Merry, and many others, proving that he is the king.</p>
<p>The Rohirrim arrive. The armies of Gondor and Rohan fight the armies of Mordor in the <i>Battle of the Pelennor Fields</i>. King Théoden is killed. Dernhelm, who was really <a href="../../../%C3%A9/o/w/%C3%89owyn.html" title="Éowyn">Éowyn</a>, kills the <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch-king_of_Angmar_6446.html" title="Witch-king of Angmar">Witch-king</a> with Merry's help. Aragorn comes with a fleet of black ships and another army of men, from the south up the river Anduin. Together they win the <i>Battle of the Pelennor Fields</i>.</p>
<p>Legolas and Gimli go into Minas Tirith and meet Merry and Pippin again. There they also tell how they got the black ships with the help of the Army of the Dead. The leaders of the the armies of Men decide to attack Mordor, as a distraction so that Frodo can destroy the One Ring. Aragorn and Gandaly lead an army of 7000 men to the Black Gate of Mordor. There they fight the <i>Battle of the Morannon</i> against the overwhelmingly large army of Sauron. During the battle Pippin falls unconcious, but he hears that the Great Eagles have come to help them.</p>

<p>Samwise comes to the Tower of Cirith Ungol, but the different Orc groups in it had a fight and all killed each other. Sam frees Frodo and gives him back the One Ring. The two hobbits escape and continue their journey through Mordor. It is a hard journey, and the Ring's influence on Frodo is very strong now. The hobbits come to Mount Doom, where they are attacked by Gollum, who still wants the One Ring. Frodo goes on alone into Mount Doom, but Sam has pity for Gollum and lets him live. Sam follows Frodo into Mount Doom. Frodo is finally overpowered by the One Ring, says it belongs to him and puts the Ring on, which makes Sauron know he is there. Gollum comes back once more and fights with Frodo. Gollum bites off Frodo's finger with the Ring. Gollum is happy to have his Ring back, but makes a mistake. Gollum and the One Ring fall into the volcano, and the Ring is destroyed. Sauron fully dies and his fortress Barad-dûr is destroyed.</p>
<p>At the <i>Battle of the Morannon</i>, the Orcs and other evil creatures no longer know what to do and are defeated easily, and the Battle is won. Gandalf calls three of the Eagles, who then rescue Frodo and Sam.</p>

The journey home.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>They all return to Minas Tirith. Aragorn becomes King of Gondor and Arnor. Elves from Rivendell and Lothlórien come to Minas Tirith. Aragon marries Arwen Undómiel, daughter of Elrond. The fellowship, the elves, and the Rohirrim go back to Rohan. King Théoden is buried. Éomer officialy becomes King of Rohan, and Éowyn and Faramir are married. They go on to Helm's Deep, were the fellowship finally splits. Aragorn goes back to Minas Tirith, and Legolas and Gimli also leave to travel to their homes in the northeast. The elves, hobbits and Gandalf go on. At Isedgard they are told that Saruman has left. Galadriel and the Lothlórien-elves leave the group to go back home east over the mountains. The others come to Rivendell, where the hobbits meet Bilbo again.</p>
<p>The four hobbits and Gandalf leave Rivendell, to travel back to the Shire. Gandalf leaves the hobbits after Bree. The four hobbits come to the Shire, but Saruman with his men has taken over the land. Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, and the other hobbits start to fight them, and they free themselves and the Shire. They find Saruman and Gríma at Bag End. Frodo wants to send them away unhurt, but Saruman is killed by Gríma. Gríma is shot by hobbit archers.</p>
<p>Some years later Frodo and Sam go to meet Bilbo, Elrond, and Galadriel, and some other elves. They all go to the Grey Havens, where they meet Gandalf, and also Merry and Pippin. The Ring-beares Bilbo and Frodo, together with Gandalf and the elves, leave Middle-earth, and go west across the sea to Valinor. The Fourth Age of Middle-earth begins. The three remaining hobbits go back to the Shire, and Sam returns to his wife and child.</p>
