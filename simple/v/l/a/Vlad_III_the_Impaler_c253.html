<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlad_III_the_Impaler_c253.html" title="Edit section: Names">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Names</span></h2>
<p>His Romanian surname <i>Drăculea</i> (transliterated as "Dracula" in foreign languages of the historical documents where his name is mentioned) is a diminutive derived from his father's title <i>Dracul</i> and means "Son of the Dragon". His father was Vlad II Dracul. His father was a member of the <i>Order of the Dragon</i> created by Emperor Sigismund. Vlad's family had two factions, the <i>Drăculeşti</i> and the <i>Dăneşti</i>. The word "dracul" means "the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil.html" title="Devil">Devil</a>" in modern Romanian but in Vlad's day also meant "dragon" or "demon", and derives from the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> word <i>Draco</i>, meaning "dragon" as well.</p>
<p>After his death, he also got the surname <i>Ţepeş</i> (Impaler). This probably came from his preferred method for executing his opponents, impalement - as popularized by medieval <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transylvania.html" title="Transylvania">Transylvanian</a> pamphlets. In Turkish, he was known as "<i>Kazıklı Bey</i>" IPA: [<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">kɑzɨkˈɫɨ</span>] which means "Impaler Prince". Vlad was referred to as <i>Dracula</i> in a number of documents of his times, mainly the Transylvanian Saxon pamphlets and <i>The Annals of Jan Długosz</i>.</p>
<p>Outside Wallachia he was known by the exaggerated tales of atrocities. Many of these tales come from records of debatable authenticity. The title of <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire.html" title="Vampire">vampire</a>, and his title Dracula was the source of inspiration for the name of the main character of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bram_Stoker_987d.html" title="Bram Stoker">Bram Stoker</a>'s 1897 horror novel, <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracula.html" title="Dracula">Dracula</a></i>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown.html" title="Crown">crown</a> of Wallachia was not passed automatically from father to son. Instead, the leader was elected by the boyars, with the requirement that the Prince-elect be of nominally Basarab princely lineage (<i>os de domn</i> - "of voivode bones", "of voivode marrow"). This included out of wedlock births. This elective monarchy often resulted in instability, family disputes and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassinations</a>. Eventually, the princely house split between two factions: the descendants of Mircea the Elder, Vlad's grandfather; and those of another prince, Dan II (Dăneşti faction). In addition to that, as in all feudal states, there was another struggle between the central administration (the prince) and the high nobility for control over the country. The two powerful neighbors of Wallachia, the Kingdom of Hungary and the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, were at the peak of their rivalry for control of southeastern Europe. This made Wallachia a battle ground.</p>

<p>His father, Vlad II Dracul, born around 1395, was an illegitimate son of Mircea the Elder, an important early Wallachian ruler. As a young man, he had joined the court of Sigismund of Luxemburg, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Emperor_674b.html" title="Holy Roman Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> and King of Hungary, whose support for claiming the throne of Wallachia he eventually acquired. A sign of this support was the fact that in 1431 Vlad II was introduced into the Order of the Dragon (<i>Societas Draconis</i> in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_language.html" title="Latin language">Latin</a>), along with the rulers of Poland and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>. The purpose of the Order was to protect <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Europe_ef2f.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a> and the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Empire_f314.html" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> from <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islamic</a> expansion. The main threat of this was seem in the campaigns of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>Because he wanted to assert his status, Vlad II displayed the symbol of the Order, (a <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon.html" title="Dragon">dragon</a>), in all public appearances, (on flags, clothing, etc.). The old Romanian word for serpent (Cf. <i>drac</i>) is nowadays the most common and casual reference to the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil.html" title="Devil">devil</a>. The people of Wallachia did give Vlad II the surname <i>Dracu</i> (<i>Dracul</i> being the more grammatically correct form). Any connection with a dark power was most likely coincidental at that time. His son Vlad III would later use the surname <i>Drăculea</i> in several documents . Through various translations (<i>Draculea</i>, <i>Drakulya</i>) Vlad III eventually came to be known as <i>Dracula</i> (note that this ultimate version is a neologism in Romanian).</p>
<p>Vlad II finally became prince of Wallachia in 1436. During his reign he tried to steer between his powerful neighbors. He opposed various initiatives of war against the Ottomans. This finally irritated the Hungarian side, who accused him of disloyalty and removed him in 1442. With the help of the Turks (where he also had connections) he regained the throne in 1443 and until December 1447 when he was assassinated by means of scalping ("scalping", for the Turks, meant cutting the edges of the face and pulling the face's skin off, while the person was still alive and conscious<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>) on the orders of John Hunyadi, regent of Hungary.</p>
<p>The identity of Vlad Dracula’s mother is somewhat uncertain. The most likely variant is that she was a Moldavian princess, niece or daughter of Moldavian prince Alexandru cel Bun. In some sources she is named Chiajna - Princess. Vlad seems to have had a very close relationship with Moldavia: he spent several years there after his father’s death; he left with his presumed cousin Stephen the Great to Transylvania, and helped the latter gain the crown as Prince of Moldavia in 1457. Stephen later helped Vlad III to return to the throne of Wallachia in 1476.</p>
<p>Vlad III seems to have had three brothers. The oldest, probably named Mircea, born before 1430, briefly held his father's throne in 1442. He was sent by Vlad Dracul to fight in his place during the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">crusade</a> against the Turks in 1444. This Crusade ended with the Varna defeat. Mircea met his end along with his father in 1447. Presumably he was buried alive, possibly alongside his father. Vlad IV, also known as Vlad Călugarul (Vlad the Monk), was born around 1425 to 1430, and was Vlad's half-brother. Vlad the Monk spent many years in Transylvania waiting for a chance to get the throne of Wallachia. Vlad the Monk tried a religious career in the meantime, until he became prince of Wallachia in 1482. Radu, known as Radu cel Frumos (Radu the Handsome), the youngest brother, was also Vlad’s most important rival as he continuously tried to replace Vlad with the support of the Turks, to which he had very strong connections. Radu also seems to have been favoured by the Turkish Sultan <a href="../../../m/e/h/Mehmed_II_5655.html" title="Mehmed II">Mehmed II</a>.</p>
<p>From his first marriage, to a Wallachian noble woman, Vlad III had a son, later prince of Wallachia as Mihnea cel Rău, and another two with his second wife, a relative of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary.</p>

<p>Vlad was very likely born in the city of Sighişoara in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transylvania.html" title="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>, during the winter of 1431. Sighişoara was a military fortress at that time. He was born as the second son to his father Vlad Dracul and his mother Princess Cneajna of Moldavia. He had an older brother Mircea and a younger brother Radu, the Handsome. Although his native country was Wallachia to the south, the family lived in exile in Transylvania as his father had been ousted by pro-Ottoman boyars. In the same year as his birth, his father, Vlad Dracul, travelled to <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg.html" title="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>, where he was invested into the Order of the Dragon. At the age of five, young "Vlad" was also initiated into the Order of the Dragon.</p>

<p>Vlad's father was under considerable political pressure from the Ottoman sultan. Threatened with invasion, he gave a promise to be the <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vassal.html" title="Vassal">vassal</a> of the Sultan and gave up his two younger sons as hostages so that he would keep his promise.</p>
<p>Vlad suffered much at the hands of the Ottoman, and was locked up in an underground dungeon; however, his younger brother, Radu, caught the eye of the sultan's son. Radu was released and converted to Islam, before being allowed into the Ottoman royal court.</p>
<p>These years had a great influence on Vlad. They shaped Vlad's character. He was often whipped by his Ottoman captors for being stubborn and rude. He developed a well-known hatred for Radu and for Mehmed, who would later become the sultan. According to McNally and Florescu, he also distrusted his own father for trading him to the Turks and betraying the Order of the Dragon oath to fight them.</p>

<p>Vlad's father was assassinated in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marsh.html" title="Marsh">marshes</a> near Bălteni in December of 1447 by rebellious boyars. These were allegedly under the orders of John Hunyadi. Vlad's older brother Mircea was also dead at this point, blinded with hot iron stakes and buried alive by his political enemies at Târgovişte. To protect their political power in the region, the Ottomans invaded Wallachia and the Sultan put Vlad III on the throne as his puppet ruler. His rule at this time would be brief; Hunyadi himself invaded Wallachia and ousted him the same year. Vlad fled to Moldavia until October of 1451 and was put under the protection of his uncle, Bogdan II.</p>

<p>Bogdan was assassinated. Vlad took a chance and fled to Hungary. Impressed by Vlad's vast knowledge of the mindset, military and inner workings of the Ottoman Empire as well as his hatred of the new sultan <a href="../../../m/e/h/Mehmed_II_5655.html" title="Mehmed II">Mehmed II</a>, Hunyadi pardoned him and took him in as an advisor. Eventually Hunyadi put him forward as the Kingdom of Hungary's candidate for the throne of Wallachia.</p>
<p>In 1456, Hungary invaded <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> to drive out the Ottomans, and Vlad III simultaneously invaded Wallachia with his own contingent. Both campaigns were successful. Hunyadi suddenly died of the plague. Nevertheless, Vlad was now prince of his native land.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlad_III_the_Impaler_c253.html" title="Edit section: Main reign (1456&amp;ndash;62)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Main reign (1456–62)</span></h4>
<p>Vlad's actions after 1456 are well documented. He seems to have led the life of all the other princes of Wallachia, spending most of his time at the court of Târgovişte, occasionally in other important cities, such as <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucharest.html" title="Bucharest">Bucharest</a> - that he founded. He made laws, met foreign envoys and presided over important judicial trials. He probably made public appearances on relevant occasions, such as religious holidays and major fairs. As a pastime he probably enjoyed hunting on the vast princely domain, with his more or less loyal friends. He made some additions to the palace in Târgovişte (out of which Chindia Tower is today the most notable remainder), reinforced some castles, like the one at Poienari, where he also had a personal house built nearby. He also made donations to various churches and monasteries, one such place being the monastery at Lake Snagov where he is supposed to have been buried<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>During the early part of his reign, Vlad wanted to eliminate all possible threats to his power, mainly the rival nobility groups, i.e. the boyars. This was done mainly by physical elimination, but also by reducing the economic role of the nobility: the key positions in the Prince’s Council, traditionally belonging to the country’s greatest boyars, were handed to obscure individuals, some of them of foreign origin, but who manifested loyalty towards Vlad. For the less important functions, Vlad also ignored the old boyars, preferring to <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">knight</a> and appoint men from the free peasantry. A key element of the power of the Wallachian nobility was their connections in the Saxon - populated autonomous towns of Transylvania, so Vlad acted against these cities by eliminating their trade privileges in relation with Wallachia and by organizing raids against them.</p>
<p>Another problem was that the constant state of war since the death of his grandfather Mircea the Elder in 1418. This had led to an increase in crime levels as well as falling agricultural production. It also had an impact on trade. Trade had almost disappeared in Wallachia. Vlad tried to solve these problems with severe methods. He needed an economically stable country to have a chance to withstand his external enemies.</p>
<p>Vlad III was also constantly on guard against the adherents of the Dăneşti clan. Some of his raids into Transylvania may have been efforts to capture would-be princes of the Dăneşti. Several members of the Dăneşti clan died at Vlad's hands. Vladislav II of Wallachia was murdered soon after Vlad came to power in 1456. Another Dăneşti prince was captured during one of Vlad's forays into Transylvania. Rumors (spread by his enemies) say thousands of citizens of the town that had sheltered his rival were impaled by Vlad. The captured Dăneşti prince was forced to read his own funeral oration while he kneeled before an open grave before his execution.</p>

<p>The greatest threat to Vlad’s position was the rivalry in southeastern Europe between the Ottoman Empire and the Hungarian Kingdom. Following family traditions, Vlad decided to side with the Hungarians. To the end of the <a href="../../../1/4/5/1450s.html" title="1450s">1450s</a> there was once again talk about a war against the Turks, in which the king of Hungary, Matthias Corvinus would play the main role. Knowing this, Vlad stopped paying money to the Ottoman in 1459 and around 1460 made a new alliance with Corvinus. The Turks did not like this and tried to remove him from power. They failed; later, in the winter of 1461 to 1462 Vlad crossed south of the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danube.html" title="Danube">Danube</a> and devastated the area between Serbia and the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sea_23fa.html" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>, leaving over 20,000 people dead.</p>
<p>In response to this, Sultan <a href="../../../m/e/h/Mehmed_II_5655.html" title="Mehmed II">Mehmed II</a>, the recent conqueror of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, raised an army of around 60,000 men and headed towards Wallachia in the spring of 1462. With his army of 20,000-30,000 men Vlad was unable to stop the Turks from entering Wallachia. The Turks occupied the capital Târgovişte (<a href="../../../j/u/n/June_4.html" title="June 4">June 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/4/6/1462.html" title="1462">1462</a>), so he resorted to <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerrilla_warfare.html" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrilla war</a>. He constantly made small attacks and ambushes on the Turks. The most important of these attacks took place on the night of June 16/17, when Vlad and some of his men allegedly entered the main Turkish camp (wearing Ottoman disguises) and attempted to assassinate Mehmed. The Turks eventually left the country, but not before installing Vlad’s brother, Radu the Handsome, as the new prince; he gathered support from the nobility and chased Vlad to Transylvania, and by August 1462 he had struck a deal with the Hungarian Crown. Consequently, Vlad was imprisoned by Matthias Corvinus.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlad_III_the_Impaler_c253.html" title="Edit section: In captivity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In captivity</span></h4>
<p>The exact length of Vlad's period of captivity is open to some debate. The Russian pamphlets indicate that he was a prisoner from 1462 until 1474. Apparently his imprisonment was none too onerous. He was able to gradually win his way back into the graces of Hungary's monarch; so much so that he was able to meet and marry a member of the royal family (the cousin of Matthias) and have two sons who were about ten years old when he reconquered Wallachia in 1476. McNally and Florescu place Vlad III the Impaler's actual period of confinement at about four years from 1462 to 1466. It is unlikely that a prisoner would have been allowed to marry into the royal family. Diplomatic correspondence from Buda during the period in question also seems to support the claim that Vlad's actual period of confinement was relatively short.</p>
<p>The openly pro-Turkish policy of Vlad's brother, Radu (who was prince of Wallachia during most of Vlad's captivity), was a probable factor in Vlad's rehabilitation. During his captivity, Vlad also adopted <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholicism</a>. It is interesting to note that the Muscovy narrative, normally very favorable to Vlad Ţepeş, indicates that even in captivity he could not give up his favorite pastime; he often captured birds and mice which he proceeded to torture and mutilate — some were beheaded or tarred-and-feathered and released, most were impaled on tiny spears.</p>
<p>Apparently in the years before his final release in 1474 (when he began preparations for the reconquest of Wallachia), Vlad resided with his new wife in a house in the Hungarian capital (the setting of the thief anecdote). Vlad had a son from an earlier marriage, Mihnea cel Rău. His first wife, whose name is not recorded, died during the siege of his castle in 1462. The Turkish army surrounded Poienari Castle, led by his half-brother Radu the Handsome. An archer shot an arrow through a window into Vlad's main quarters, with a message warning him that Radu's army was approaching. McNally and Florescu explain that the archer was a former servant of Vlad who sent the warning out of loyalty despite having converted to Islam to get out of enslavement by the Turks. Upon reading the message, Vlad's wife flung herself off the tower into a tributary of the Argeş River flowing below the castle. According to legend she remarked that she "would rather have her body rot and be eaten by the fish of the Argeş than be led into captivity by the Turks." Today, the tributary is called Râul Doamnei (the Lady's River).</p>

<p>Around <a href="../../../1/4/7/1475.html" title="1475">1475</a> Vlad the Impaler was again ready to make another bid for power. Vlad and voivode Stefan Báthory of Transylvania invaded Wallachia with a mixed force of Transylvanians, a few dissatisfied Wallachian boyars, and a contingent of Moldavians sent by Vlad's cousin, Prince Stephen III of Moldavia. Vlad's brother, Radu the Handsome, had died a couple of years earlier and had been replaced on the Wallachian throne by another Ottoman candidate, Basarab the Elder, a member of the Dăneşti clan. At the approach of Vlad's army, Basarab and his cohorts fled, some to the protection of the Turks, others to the shelter of the Transylvanian Alps. After placing Vlad Ţepeş on the throne, Stephen Báthory and the bulk of Vlad's forces returned to Transylvania, leaving Vlad in a very weak position. Vlad had little time to gather support before a large Ottoman army entered Wallachia determined to return Basarab to the throne. Vlad's cruelties over the years had alienated the boyars who felt they had a better chance of surviving under Prince Basarab. Apparently, even the peasants, tired of the depredations of Vlad, abandoned him to his fate. Vlad was forced to march to meet the Turks with the small forces at his disposal, somewhat less than four thousand men.</p>
<p>There are several variants of Vlad III the Impaler's death. Some sources say he was killed in battle against the Ottoman near Bucharest in December of 1476. Others say he was assassinated by disloyal Wallachian boyars just as he was about to sweep the Turks from the field or during a hunt. Other accounts have Vlad falling in defeat, surrounded by the bodies of his loyal Moldavian bodyguards (the troops loaned by Prince Stephen remained with Vlad after Stephen Báthory returned to his country). Still other reports claim that Vlad, at the moment of victory, was accidentally struck down by one of his own men. Vlad's body was <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decapitation.html" title="Decapitation">decapitated</a> by the Turks and his head was sent to <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> and preserved in honey, where the sultan had it displayed on a stake as proof that <i>Kazıklı Bey</i> was dead. He was reportedly buried at a monastery located near Bucharest, yet the exact place of his burial remains unknown, as excavations at Snagov monastery, usually mentioned as his final resting place, have found no human remains.</p>

<p>Romanian oral tradition provides another important source for the life of Vlad the Impaler: legends and tales concerning the Impaler have remained a part of folklore among the Romanian peasantry. These tales have been passed down from generation to generation for five hundred years. Through constant retelling they have become somewhat garbled and confused and they have gradually been forgotten in later years. However, they still provide valuable information about Dracula and his relationship with his people. Many of the tales contained in the pamphlets are also found in the oral tradition, though with a somewhat different emphasis. Among the Romanian peasantry, Vlad Ţepeş was remembered as a just prince who defended his people from foreign aggression, whether those foreigners were Turkish invaders or German merchants. He is also remembered as a champion of the common man against the oppression of the boyars. National poet of Romania, Mihai Eminescu wrote the memorable verses <i>"Unde eşti tu, Ţepeş Doamne, ca punând mâna pe ei, Să-i împarţi în două cete: în smintiţi şi în mişei"</i> (<i>where are you, lord Ţepeş, to get them and split them into two gangs, fools and rascals"</i>). Vlad's fierce insistence on honesty is a central part of the oral tradition. Many of the anecdotes contained in the pamphlets and in the oral tradition demonstrate the prince's efforts to eliminate crime and dishonesty from his domain. Presidential candidate Traian Băsescu referred to Vlad Ţepeş and his method of punishing illegalities in his anticorruption discourse during the election campaign of 2004.</p>
<p>However, despite the more positive interpretation, the Romanian oral tradition also remembers Vlad as an exceptionally cruel and often capricious ruler. There are several events that are common to all the pamphlets, regardless of their nation of origin. Many of these events are also found in the Romanian oral tradition. Specific details may vary among the different versions of these anecdotes but the general course of events usually agrees to a remarkable extent. For example, in some versions the foreign ambassadors received by Vlad Ţepeş at Târgovişte are <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence.html" title="Florence">Florentine</a>, in others they are <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> (McNally and Florescu believe he may have done this to both nationalities at different times). The nature of their offense against the Prince also varies from version to version. However, all versions agree that Vlad, in response to some real or imagined insult (perhaps because they refused to remove them in Vlad's presence), had their hats nailed to their heads. Some of the sources view Vlad's actions as justified, others view his acts as crimes of wanton and senseless cruelty.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Woodblock print of Vlad III attending a mass impalement.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Vlad III Ţepeş has been characterized, by some, as exceedingly cruel. Impalement was Ţepeş's preferred method of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">torture</a> and <a href="../../../e/x/e/Execution.html" title="Execution">execution</a>. His method of torture was a horse attached to each of the victim's legs as a sharpened stake was gradually forced into the body. The end of the stake was usually oiled, and care was taken that the stake not be too sharp; else the victim might die too rapidly from shock. Normally the stake was inserted into the body through the <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anus.html" title="Anus">anus</a> and was often forced through the body until it emerged from the mouth. However, there were many instances where victims were impaled through other bodily orifices or through the abdomen or chest. Infants were sometimes impaled on the stake forced through their mother's chests. The records indicate that victims were sometimes impaled so that they hung upside down on the stake.</p>
<p>As expected, death by impalement was slow and painful. Victims sometimes endured for hours or days. Vlad often had the stakes arranged in various geometric patterns. The most common pattern was a ring of concentric circles in the outskirts of a city that constituted his target. The height of the spear indicated the rank of the victim. The corpses were often left decaying for months.</p>
<p>There are claims that thousands of people were impaled at a single time. One such claim says 10,000 were impaled in the Transylvanian city of <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibiu.html" title="Sibiu">Sibiu</a> (where Vlad the Impaler had once lived) in 1460. Another allegation asserts that during the previous year, on Saint Bartholomew's Day (in August), Vlad the Impaler had 30,000 of the merchants and officials of the Transylvanian city of Braşov that were breaking his authority impaled. One of the most famous woodcuts of the period shows Vlad the Impaler feasting amongst a forest of stakes and their grisly burdens outside Braşov, while a nearby executioner cuts apart other victims.</p>
<p>Impalement was Vlad the Impaler's favourite but, like most European royalty, by no means his only method of torture. The list of tortures employed by many heads of state is extensive: nails in heads, cutting off of limbs, blinding, strangulation, burning, cutting off of noses and ears, mutilation of sexual organs (especially in the case of women), scalping, skinning, exposure to the elements or to animals, and boiling alive. An old Romanian story says that one could even leave a bag of gold in the middle of the street, then return and pick it up the next day, as people were so afraid to commit crimes during his reign due to these horrific means of torture and capital punishment.</p>
<p>No one was immune to Vlad the Impaler's attentions. His victims included women and children, peasants and great lords, ambassadors from foreign powers and merchants. However, the vast majority of his European victims came from the merchants and boyars of Transylvania and his own country, Wallachia. Many have attempted to justify Vlad's actions on the basis of nascent <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> and political necessity. Most of the merchants in Transylvania and Wallachia were Saxons who were seen as parasites, preying upon Romanian natives of Wallachia, while the boyars had proven their disloyalty time and time again (Vlad's own father and older brother were murdered by unfaithful boyars). His actions were likely driven by one or more of three motives: personal or political vendettas, the establishment of iron-fisted law and order in Wallachia, and nationalizing the province's economy through policies that would be identified today as economic nationalism.</p>
<p>Vlad Ţepeş is alleged to have committed even more impalements and other tortures against invading Ottoman forces. It was reported that an invading Ottoman army turned back in fright when it encountered thousands of rotting corpses impaled on the banks of the Danube. It has also been said that in 1462 <a href="../../../m/e/h/Mehmed_II_5655.html" title="Mehmed II">Mehmed II</a>, the conqueror of Constantinople, a man not noted for his squeamishness, returned to Constantinople after being sickened by the sight of 20,000 impaled corpses outside of Vlad's capital of Târgovişte. Many of the victims were Turkish prisoners of war Vlad had previously captured during the Turkish invasion. The total Turkish casualty toll in this battle reached over 40,000. The warrior sultan turned command of the campaign against Vlad over to subordinates and returned to Istanbul, even though his army had initially outnumbered Vlad's three to one and was better equipped.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as he came to power, his first significant act of cruelty may have been motivated by a desire of revenge as well as a need to solidify his power. Early in his reign he gave a feast for his boyars and their families to celebrate <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter.html" title="Easter">Easter</a>. Vlad was well aware that many of these same nobles were part of the conspiracy that led to his father's <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassination</a> and the burying alive of his elder brother, Mircea. Many had also played a role in the overthrow of numerous Wallachian princes. During the feast Vlad asked his noble guests how many princes had ruled during their life times. All of the nobles present had outlived several princes. One answered that at least thirty princes had held the throne during his life. None had seen less than seven reigns. Vlad immediately had all the assembled nobles arrested. The older boyars and their families were impaled on the spot. The younger and healthier nobles and their families were marched north from Târgovişte to the ruins of Poienari Castle in the mountains above the Argeş River. Vlad the Impaler was determined to rebuild this ancient fortress as his own stronghold and refuge. The enslaved boyars and their families were forced to labor for months rebuilding the old castle with materials from another nearby ruin. According to the reports, they labored until the clothes fell off their bodies and then were forced to continue working naked. Very few of the old gentry survived the ordeal of building Vlad's castle.</p>
<p>Throughout his reign, Vlad systematically eradicated the old boyar class of Wallachia. The old boyars had repeatedly undermined the power of the prince during previous reigns and had been responsible for the violent overthrow of several princes. Apparently Vlad Ţepeş was determined that his own power be on a modern and thoroughly secure footing. In place of the executed boyars, Vlad promoted new men from among the free peasantry and middle class; men who would be loyal only to their prince. Many of Vlad's acts can be interpreted as efforts to strengthen and modernize the central government at the expense of the decaying feudal powers of nobility carried over from the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>.</p>

<p>Much of the information we have about Vlad III Ţepeş comes from pamphlets published in the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Empire_f314.html" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and chronicles written in Muscovy. The first known German pamphlet dates from 1488 and it is possible that some were printed during Vlad’s lifetime. At least initially, they may have been politically inspired. At that time Matthias Corvinus of Hungary was seeking to bolster his own reputation in the Empire and may have intended the early pamphlets as justification of his less than vigorous support of his vassal. The pamphlets were also a form of mass entertainment in a society where the printing press was just coming into widespread use. Much like the subject matter of the supermarket tabloids of today, the cruel life of the Wallachian tyrant was easily sensationalized. The pamphlets were reprinted numerous times over the thirty or so years following Vlad's death -- strong proof of their popularity. The German pamphlets painted Vlad Ţepeş as an inhuman monster who terrorized the land and butchered innocents with sadistic glee. The Russian pamphlets took a somewhat different view. The princes of Muscovy were at the time just beginning to build the basis of what would become the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autocracy.html" title="Autocracy">autocracy</a> of the <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsar.html" title="Tsar">tsars</a>. They were also having considerable trouble with disloyal, often troublesome boyars. In Muscovy, Vlad was presented as a cruel but just prince whose actions were directed toward the greater good of his people. Despite the differences in interpretation, the pamphlets, regardless of their land of origin, agree remarkably well as to specifics. The level of agreement has led most historians to conclude that at least the broad outlines of the events covered actually occurred.</p>
<p>Vlad's atrocities against the people of Wallachia were usually attempts to enforce his own moral code upon his country. According to the pamphlets, he appears to have been particularly concerned with female <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chastity.html" title="Chastity">chastity</a>. Maidens who lost their <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginity.html" title="Virginity">virginity</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adultery.html" title="Adultery">adulterous</a> wives, and unchaste widows were all targets of Vlad's cruelty. Such women often had their sexual organs cut out or their breasts cut off. They were also often impaled through the <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vagina.html" title="Vagina">vagina</a> on red-hot stakes that were forced through the body until they emerged from the mouth.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> One report tells of the execution of an unfaithful wife. Dracula had the woman's breasts cut off, then she was skinned and impaled in a square in Târgovişte with her skin lying on a nearby table.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> Vlad also insisted that his people be honest and hard-working. Merchants who cheated their customers were likely to find themselves mounted on a stake beside common thieves.</p>

<p>It is unclear why <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bram_Stoker_987d.html" title="Bram Stoker">Bram Stoker</a> chose this Wallachian prince as the model for his fictional <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire.html" title="Vampire">vampire</a>.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> Stoker was a friend of a Hungarian professor (Arminius Vambery/Hermann Vamberger) from <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>, and many have suggested that Vlad's name might have been mentioned by this friend. Regardless of how the name came to Stoker's attention, the cruel history of the Impaler would have readily loaned itself to Stoker's purposes. The events of Vlad's life were played out in a region of the world that was still basically medieval even in Stoker's time. The <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkans.html" title="Balkans">Balkans</a> had only recently shaken off the Turkish yoke when Stoker started working on his novel and ancient superstitions were still prevalent. Transylvania had long been a part of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria-Hungary_d732.html" title="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a>, but it had also been an Ottoman vassal (although it never fell under Turkish domination, and was in fact semi-independent and at times under Habsburg influence).</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that Stoker knew little of the Prince of Wallachia. Some have claimed that the novel owes more to the legends about Elizabeth Báthory. (<i>See <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracula.html#Historical_connections" title="Dracula">Dracula - Historical connections</a> for more detail</i>).</p>
<p>The legendary vampire was and still is deeply rooted in that region. There have always been vampire-like creatures in various stories from across the world. However, the vampire, as he became known in Europe, largely originated in <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_peoples.html" title="Slavic peoples">Southern Slavic</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greek</a> folklore — although the tale is virtually absent in Romanian culture. A veritable epidemic of vampirism swept through Eastern Europe beginning in the late <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a> and continuing through the <a href="../../../1/7/0/1700s.html" title="1700s">1700s</a>. The number of reported cases rose dramatically in Hungary and the Balkans. From the Balkans, the "plague" spread westward into <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>. Travelers returning from the Balkans brought with them tales of the undead, igniting an interest in the vampire that has continued to this day. Philosophers in the West began to study the phenomenon. It was during this period that Dom Augustine Calmet wrote his famous treatise on vampirism in Hungary. It was also during this period that authors and playwrights first began to explore the vampire legend. Stoker's novel was merely the culminating work of a long series of works that were inspired by the reports coming from the Balkans and Hungary.</p>
<p>Given the history of the vampire legend in Europe it is perhaps natural that Stoker should place his great vampire in the heart of the region that gave birth to the story. Once Stoker had determined on a locality Vlad Dracula would stand out as one of the most notorious rulers of the selected region. He was obscure enough that few would recognize the name and those who did would know him for his acts of brutal cruelty; Dracula was a natural candidate for vampirism. Why Stoker chose to relocate his vampire from Wallachia to the north of Transylvania remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Tales of vampires are still widespread in Eastern Europe. Similarly, the name of Dracula is still remembered in the Romanian oral tradition but that is the end of any connection between Dracula and the folkloric vampire. Outside of Stoker's novel the name of Dracula was never linked with the vampires encountered in the folklore. Despite his inhuman cruelty, in Romania Dracula is remembered as a national hero who resisted the Turkish conquerors and asserted Romanian national sovereignty against the powerful Hungarian kingdom. He is also remembered in a similar manner in other Balkan countries, as he fought against the Turks.</p>
<p>There are some legends saying that Vlad, after being taken captive by the Hungarians, had his eyes taken out and then was buried alive. The next day, they dug up the spot where he was buried and found no corpse. Several years later, there were numerous mysterious deaths at his castle.</p>
<p>It is somewhat ironic that Vlad's name has often been thrown into the political and ethnic feuds between Hungarians and Romanians, because he was ultimately far from an enemy of Hungary. While he certainly had violent conflicts with some Hungarian nobles, he had just as many Hungarian friends and allies, and his successes in battle with the Turks largely benefited Hungary in the long term. Hungary later found itself under siege but was never entirely penetrated by Ottoman forces. Though neither the first nor the last powerful ruler to take on the Ottoman Empire, Dracula's demoralizing battle tactics were quite influential in damaging the illusion of Turkish invincibility and reversing the European aura of appeasement.</p>
<p>Romanian folklore and poetry paints Vlad Tepeş as a hero, anything but a vampire. His favorite weapon was the stake. Together with his reputation in his native country as a man who stood up to both foreign and domestic enemies, gives Dracula the virtual opposite symbolism of Bram Stoker's vampire. For this reason, the association of his name with vampirism does not make sense to Romanians. In Romania he is still considered by some to be a "savior" to the people of his country. He is also considered one of the greatest leaders and defenders of Romania and was voted one of "100 Greatest Romanians" in the <i>Mari Români</i> television series aired in 2006.</p>
<p>A good description of Vlad Dracula survives courtesy of Nicholas of Modrussa, who wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>He was not very tall, but very stocky and strong, with a cruel and terrible appearance, a long straight nose, distended nostrils, a thin and reddish face in which the large wide-open green eyes were enframed by bushy black eyebrows, which made them appear threatening. His face and chin were shaven but for a moustache. The swollen temples increased the bulk of his head. A bull's neck supported the head, from which black curly locks were falling to his wide-shouldered person.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His famous contemporary portrait, rediscovered by Romanian historians in the late <a href="../../../1/8/0/1800s.html" title="1800s">1800s</a>, had been featured in the gallery of horrors at <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innsbruck.html" title="Innsbruck">Innsbruck</a>'s Ambras Castle. It is significant support for the Romanian counter-legend that the Romanian intellectual Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, claiming to apply Johann Kaspar Lavater's method to Vlad's depiction in one of the woodcuts, concluded that his subject mostly resembled the likes of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> and Cesare Borgia.</p>
<p>Ţepeş' image in modern Romanian culture has been established in reaction to foreign perceptions: while Stoker's book did a lot to generate outrage with nationalists, it is the last part of a rather popular previous poem by Mihai Eminescu, <i>Scrisoarea a III-a</i>, that helped turn Vlad's image into modern legend, by having him stand as a figure to contrast with presumed social decay under the Phanariotes and the political scene of the <a href="../../../1/8/0/1800s.html" title="1800s">1800s</a> (even suggesting that Vlad's violent methods be applied as a cure). This judgement was in tune with the ideology of the inward-looking <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regime.html" title="Regime">regime</a> of Nicolae Ceauşescu, although the identification did little justice to Eminescu's personal beliefs.</p>
<p>All accounts of his life describe him as unrepentantly ruthless, but only the ones originating from his Saxon detractors paint him as exceptionally sadistic or somehow insane. These pamphlets continued to be published long after his death, though usually for lurid entertainment rather than propaganda purposes. It has largely been forgotten until recently that his tenacious efforts against the Ottoman Empire won him many staunch supporters in his lifetime, not just in modern day Romania but in the Kingdom of Hungary, Poland, the Republic of Venice, and even the Holy See, not to take into account Balkan countries. A Hungarian court chronicler reported that King Matthias "<i>had acted in opposition to general opinion</i>" in Hungary when he had Dracula imprisoned, and this played a considerable part in Matthias reversing his unpopular decision. During his time as a "distinguished prisoner" before being fully pardoned and allowed to reconquer Wallachia, Vlad was hailed as a Christian hero by visitors from all over Europe.</p>
<p>Of the recent literary works written in Romania about the real Vlad, only Marin Sorescu's play <i>Vlad Dracula, the Impaler</i> has been translated into <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>.</p>
