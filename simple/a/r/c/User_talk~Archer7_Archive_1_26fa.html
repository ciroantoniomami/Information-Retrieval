<li>I felt this page was slightly too complex, so I've added some phrasal verbs. Hope this helps. =)--82.47.19.206 16:21, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is a stub on them asking people to make them better, what is better than to see the page that is already done, thereby duplicating the information twice.</p>

<ul>
<li>I've just logged on, via wifi, through a public user net and got a message about vandalism and being blocked. This network is used by lots of people, so we will all have the same ISP Number allocated, so blocking it could cause problems. What is the other person doing that is causing a problem? I will stay online till you get back to me so that will keep this number to me for a while till you answer. 86.2.136.146 23:09, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hello there. I just created an account at the Simple English Wikipedia after doing lots of work for the English Wikipedia. Within 30 seconds of me creating an account I found a user with your IP address redirecting tons of our articles to the full english ones. After I warned them, they then copied the entire contents of the English articles into our versions. I've just spent 20 minutes fighting off two vandals. Don't worry, the vandalism has now stopped and nobody will block you. Thanks, <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">Archer7</a> 23:17, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thanks for that info, which pages were they vandalising, If I ask around our group we find out who it was? 86.2.136.146 23:20, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks a lot, that would be excellent! Please explain that they are ruining the hours of hard work this community has put in! More 10 articles were vandalised in the attack:</dd>

<li>Done it! It only took 9 phone calls to find it was the daughter of a friend in the village, She has a learning disability but is otherwise, at times, remarkably bright. She won't cause another problem, though she says she did change some others a few days ago, but cannot recall which. She made a comment though that was interesting:- 'There is a link from the English wiki to the simple English, but not from the Simple to the English version'. I just took a look through the articles you listed above and saw what she meant. The <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Monroe_d013.html" title="James Monroe">James Monroe</a> article does have other language links. Perhaps if you setup a bot to add the english link, and other languages, onto the simple pages that have a corresponding english page it would help. I think that would also be useful for those whose language skills are improving and want to dig deeper. 86.2.136.146 00:00, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Archer, I have only edited simple wikipedia a couple of times but mainly contribute on the english one. My user account name is <a href="../../../../en/d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" class="extiw" title="en:User:DaGizza">en:User:DaGizza</a> and I can't enter my account recently. The good news is I know what the problem is and ask one small favour from you.

<dd>Thanks for telling OwenX. However, I still can't enter my account. Can you ask whether he purge server cached? After I edited that page, it was alright until I purge server cached. You might not have to be an admin to do that. I'm not sure. If he didn't purge it can you request Thanks a lot for what you have done so far.

<p>Thanks for helping, but a little advice - when you start to feel like someone is not going to stop, especially if they start moving pages around, try and reach an <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">admin</a> via email and their en: user pages. Most vandals get bored quickly, except when they have a target (like you became) for their vandalism. It's better not to play the game... we can always fix it later. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 22:18, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I haven't been active here much longer than you (my first edit under this username was Dec 13, and my anon contribs only go back to Dec 11, other than a single one Dec 2), so my opinion is hardly authoritative, but I can't see any reason why adding any templates currently being used (at least that actually work--{Link FA} does NOT at the moment) could be a bad thing. I don't see anyone reverting additions (other than the stub-sorting ones which I agree aren't necessary at this point). I assume that keeping the list up-to-date just didn't seem like a high priority if few new editors were coming around. So, yes, in principle I do think it is something that <i>should</i> be done, even tho' in practice I have to admit I haven't even done so with the ones I've copied over ({mergeto}, {mergefrom}, {imdb name} [or {imdb title} or both] and {Geolinks-US-cityscale}, that I can remember), let alone any of the pre-existing ones I have editted. FWIW I saw you were active thru one of the most sustained vandalism attacks since I went running to Angela for assistance (fortunately she was actively editting on EN at the time) last month<a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Vandalism_in_progress&amp;diff=78029&amp;oldid=77847" class="external autonumber" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Vandalism_in_progress&amp;diff=78029&amp;oldid=77847" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Angela&amp;diff=31691637&amp;oldid=31683993" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Angela&amp;diff=31691637&amp;oldid=31683993" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, so I certainly understand what that's like. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 11:47, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not an admin, so I can't block anyone. You would need to contact <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">User:Netoholic</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">User:Ricky81682</a>, or <a href="../../../a/f/l/User%7EAflm_c6a8.html" title="User:Aflm">User:Aflm</a>. But, for whatever it's worth, that spate of vandalism wasn't too bad. If I was an admin, I might have thrown up a short block to break their rhythm, but if it keeps you from editing, I wouldn't make it very long. Reverting them was boring and a bit annoying, but nothing compared to more persistant vandals, such as the last time I contacted admins for help<a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=130.215.171.57" class="external autonumber" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=130.215.171.57" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>--that lasted more than an hour, or the time before that <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Vandalism_in_progress&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78029" class="external autonumber" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Vandalism_in_progress&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78029" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The vandal from your IP does crap for about 10 minutes (twice now, now that I check), then goes away. I would be reluctant to prevent you from contributing whenever you can/want, just to prevent vandalism that can be reversed in a couple minutes. On the other hand, since I just noticed you reverted most of the latest round, and I wouldn't want you having to spend all your free time reverting your associates at school. I just left a message for Netoholic asking if there is a way to block the vandals, without blocking you (logged in). I referenced this conversation for background <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html#IP_blocks_that_don.27t_effect_logged_in_users.3F" title="User talk:Netoholic">here</a>, so hopefully we can find the most effective, but least invasive solution. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 17:00, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the additional background info. Maybe it does need to be blocked for a spell, until their attention has wandered elsewhere. It might help (if you haven't already) to let them know that what they're doing is a) FAR from unique or original (anytime I return to Simple after hours have passed I generally have to spend at least 5-10 minutes reverting vandalism, usually from MANY different IPs), b) is seen by the people doing the reverting as more just childish/immature than anything else, and c) the reverting is mostly just boring, not really generating a strong emotional response--my face doesn't turn purple, there's no veins on my forehead threatening to pop--it's more like 'OK, I want to clean up today's vandalism before I move on to what I really wanted to do. [yawn].' <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 22:27, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm happy to point out that, consensus being reached on <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a>, you are now an admin. Make sure to review all the current <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicy_66bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Policy">policies</a>. If you intend to use the "Block user" function, you <i>must</i> keep your email address current and check it often. The big thing to remember is not to use your abilities in any conflicts (editing or otherwise) that you're directly involved. Other than that, I'd suggest starting out slowly, and feel free to contact me or another admin if you have any other questions or just need a second opinion. Try to keep to the core values of Simple:, and remember... we aren't just another EN: Wikipedia.

<dd>To clarify why, I think they should be deleted to avoid things like <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Palau&amp;diff=138185&amp;oldid=138176" class="external text" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Palau&amp;diff=138185&amp;oldid=138176" rel="nofollow">this</a>--I don't see the Simple English Wikipedia's mission as being a clone of EN, just with {unsimple} tags on top of all the articles, and a big mass of broken links and dead infobox variables. It would also avoid situations like <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannibal.html" title="Hannibal">Hannibal</a>, which has consumed who knows how many hours of people trying to simplify it, yet it probably still needs dozens of hours more work before it's even close to simple. I also don't see any point in adding grossly unsimple articles to the 150+ article backlog at <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Unsimple_pages" class="external text" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Unsimple_pages" rel="nofollow">articles needing simplification</a>, especially since no one seems willing to work on "translating" them. (I've emailed Netoholic for clarification, but Neto's lack of activity both here and EN for the past month makes me wonder if anything will come of it, plus has started me wondering whether we need to start thinking about making someone more active a bureaucrat). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 00:55, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You sent me a welcome message.</p>
<p>I will tell you that I was banned from the English Wikipedia for a year from May 2005, but they have changed their mind and added time to it. I am not sure if they will ever let me edit again. They say that they think that I am a "serial pest" because I have been involved in Wikipedia Review and have told people that Wikipedia is not perfect. I was banned because I tried to improve the accuracy of the article on the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Arthur_massacre_bdeb.html" title="Port Arthur massacre">Port Arthur massacre</a>. Today, the only improvements that you can see are the external links, and the bit about Child's Play. People at the English Wikipedia have changed everything that I wrote there. They have quoted some of the references wrongly too. I think that that article on the English Wikipedia is one of the worst articles on Wikipedia, because it is very inaccurate. I think that it is the worst article anywhere in the world about the Port Arthur massacre. It is the only place in the world that regards the views of 95% of all stories as "baseless conspiracy theories". It is the only place in the world which does not say that it was impossible for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Bryant_da7e.html" title="Martin Bryant">Martin Bryant</a> to have killed the people by himself. It is the only place in the world which does not say why Martin Bryant could not have killed the people. It is the only place in the world which does not mention that the first person to see the killer was <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendy_Scurr_17d9.html" title="Wendy Scurr">Wendy Scurr</a> and that Wendy Scurr is the main person who says that Martin Bryant was not the killer.</p>
<p>I hope that I do not get banned from Simple Wikipedia for writing this. Please let me know if I am going to be banned or not, so that I can decide if I should make an account.</p>
<p>Do you think that I am good at writing things simply? 203.122.215.44 17:42, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello. I used <a href="../../../../en/i/n/t/User%7EInternodeuser_a2c6.html" class="extiw" title="en:User:Internodeuser">en:User:Internodeuser</a>.

Good luck trying to make sense of it. I wrote a blog entry about it if you want to read that, and that might make more sense than the Arbitration case. <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/therealadrian/blog/cns!5D338A8729E83EAB!128.entry" class="external autonumber" title="http://spaces.msn.com/therealadrian/blog/cns!5D338A8729E83EAB!128.entry" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> and <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/therealadrian/blog/cns!5D338A8729E83EAB!131.entry" class="external autonumber" title="http://spaces.msn.com/therealadrian/blog/cns!5D338A8729E83EAB!131.entry" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. Talks about and proves the enormous level of censorship that went on. I am not expecting that ban to be lifted though. They will not even let me ask someone to look in to it. I am not allowed to post to the wikipedia mailing list, or write to Jimbo Wales or talk to anyone about it. No Wikipedia administrator has ever questioned the legitimacy of the ban. 203.122.215.44 20:34, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>You might want to note that I used Wikipedia conflict-free from October-December 2005 using the account called <a href="../../../../en/z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" class="extiw" title="en:User:Zordrac">en:User:Zordrac</a> before I was banned because I said that <a href="../../../../en/p/o/e/User%7EPoetlister_675f.html" class="extiw" title="en:User:Poetlister">en:User:Poetlister</a> should not have been banned, and I made a page about it <a href="../../../../en/z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_Poetlister_99f1.html" class="extiw" title="en:User:Zordrac/Poetlister">en:User:Zordrac/Poetlister</a>. Poetlister was unbanned, but the people that protested it, myself, <a href="../../../../en/m/i/s/User%7EMistress_Selina_Kyle_f76f.html" class="extiw" title="en:User:Mistress_Selina_Kyle">en:User:Mistress Selina Kyle</a> and <a href="../../../../en/b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" class="extiw" title="en:User:Bonaparte">en:User:Bonaparte</a> were all banned over it. The incident led to the userbox dispute involving <a href="../../../../en/k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" class="extiw" title="en:User:Kelly_Martin">en:User:Kelly Martin</a> that you might have heard about. I now realise that Wikipedia does not allow you to protest a ban.</p>
<p>I realise that Wikipedia controls truth. That responding to someone can be changed to make it look like I started the conversation, by deleting history. I now recognise that Wikipedia does not allow personal attacks, except for priveleged users who can get away with anything, and that even if I am personally attacked first, I am not allowed to respond to this, even if they do it hundreds of times and in a very nasty way. I now recognise that Wikipedia does not allow you to suggest that when someone threatens to kill you and says that they know your name and address and prints these to Wikipedia, then threatening to frame you for murder, that you are not allowed to tell them to stop it, or to inform them that they might be breaking the law. I recognise that Wikipedia regards this as a "legal threat".</p>
<p>I now realise that Wikipedia has many inaccurate articles, although I have never found one quite so inaccurate as the Port Arthur massacre article. I recognise that when an article is "owned" you are not allowed to edit it, and you have to respect that it is "owned" and that the best way is to ask for them to please change the text and to recognise the sources that you claim.</p>
<p>I recognise that Wikipedia is not fair. I recognise that it has many silly policies, and some that are purely unattainable and can never work, like NPOV. I realise that if I want to edit Wikipedia then I have to accept that I am doing it on Wikipedia's terms, not my own.</p>
<p>I thought that I did a pretty good job of avoiding conflict, and of helping others to avoid conflict. I got nominated for adminship, you know. Perhaps I should have accepted it. I probably wouldn't have been banned if I'd been an administrator at the time. 203.122.215.44 22:31, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Anyway, as I said before, all I am asking you is if I will be banned from the simple Wikipedia. I do not care right now if I get unbanned from En, and that is not what I am asking you. I am happy that you considered it, but that is currently beyond the realms of what I can ask. Too many lies have been told about that for it to be fixed up. And unless Wikitruth decides to expose some actual censorship like those deleted edits, then it is not going to be undone. If only Wikitruth actually exposed censorship, eh? Instead of trying to tell us that we should make fun of people with physical disabilities and stalk secret martial artists and "uncensoring" a bunch of things that were never censored to begin with. Makes you wonder who is behind Wikitruth really. Well, it makes me wonder at least. Certainly not critics, and not people who are interested in helping Wikipedia. 203.122.215.44 22:52, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The RfD/Newb issue is unfortunate, as it's the only part of the user's edit history here that I find troubling. You may have noticed I've spent quite a while today looking at their new articles, and while I'm not thrilled with the apparent fondness for conspiracy theories, and some of the fact-checking could be better, the actual edits seem to be in good faith.

<p>If you disagree with me, your primary effort should be to work with me directly, either on the wiki, by email, or by IRC. Becoming impatient and then locking a fellow admin is a horrible way to deal with a problem. If I am as bad as you say, then why would I let you block me? Hell, we could have gotten into a back-and-forth bullshit admin war. Fortunately, I'm much more rational than that. I'm not interested in a political battle, but please, for a moment, consider whether or not you and Cromwellt are trying to start one here. If you and Cromwellt want SE Wikt to become something that SE Wikipedia uses more, then you are far better off going back to SE Wikt and making it the best damn SE dictionary you possible can. I'll tell you that Angela and other people within the Foundation think that wiki should be shut down. If you really want to save it you need to work VERY hard to demonstrate that it can be made a useful alternative.</p>
<p>I'll tell you my suspicion though... that you and Cromwellt are trying to take the "easy road". You're doing the bare minimum of the hard work on SE Wikt, while debating its value on Wikipedia talk pages.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have added (a rather lengthy) comment on the talk page. One of the problem is that I do not see Netoholic's comments to be so rude as you have seen them. In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please calm down. You are much more helpful to Wiki if you are calm.</li>
<li>You didnt have a zillion options, blocking Netoholic was one of them.</li>
<li>At the moment, I think that you might have overreacted, but I need Netoholics views of what happened to corroborate/disprove this.</li>

<p>Hey Archer7,</p>
<p>You make some good points. Honestly, I'm not really angry at all, though I'm not sure why. I guess I am a little frustrated. Mostly I feel a bit cynical and critical. In any case, my comments to him are certainly not made with a very good attitude at the moment. I guess I'm just sick of this, after dealing with it for so long. Maybe he is too, I guess. But...I honestly just can't understand his side. I'm trying to get something constructive done here, something legitimate, something good. SEWikipedia and SEWiktionary, it's like pancakes and applesauce, like Bonnie and Clyde; it just <i>goes</i> together, like English Wikipedia and English Wiktionary. And I feel like he's been blocking me at every turn, just out of spite. Just because I've stood up to him, however nicely. I've always been a nice guy, so being painted in the role of the troublemaker is new to me.</p>
<p>I guess I'll let him be for now. I have to believe that the community will be as unbiased as possible. Like I told Eptalon, it's what I've been waiting for. Besides, I've got nothing to hide. I can't imagine what he'll accuse me of, even. You are right about the difficulty of conveying emotion through writing. That was one reason I didn't know how to answer him when he said "I invite you to withdraw." Oh well.

I'm also open to submitting my own name for admin access, but I'm not sure if I have sufficient presence here yet, despite the fact that I have created over 100 articles and have over 4,000 edits at the regular English wikipedia.

<p>Hey Archer7, can you please revert the redirect that Netoholic did to the description I made at <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Wiktionary_1933.html" title="Simple English Wiktionary">Simple English Wiktionary</a>? You'll have to go back a link because it is currently a redirect. Then it should probably be moved to the wikipedia: namespace, since it is a project page, not an article. Consensus agrees that the project should exist, so I think the page makes sense, especially since it was only changed to a redirect because of his campaign against the project. But I think you know very well why I don't want to touch the page myself. We should probably also make a page on the English Wiktionary as well.

<p>Thanks for an immediate response. He has been changing certain pages. For example, he/she changed the page <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripura.html" title="Tripura">Tripura</a> from <i>a state of India</i> to <i>an annexed state of India</i>. This has made the information false. Tripura is an integral part of India. In any case, any one changing a fact in this way is difficult to be spotted easily. Such a change in the English Wikipedia shall be removed immediately, at least within a reasonable time. The English wikipedia recognizes such type of vandalism when it declares: <i>"Sneaky vandalism: Vandalism which is harder to spot. Adding misinformation, changing dates or making other sensible-appearing substitutions and typos."</i> He/she has created a page Kingdom of Sikkim - it is interesting to note that the Englsih Wikipedia with more than a million pages do not have any such page!

<p>Hello, Archer7. I know this maybe something you won't want to do but would you give me sort of an overview what's happening on the Simple English Wikipedia? If your familiar with the English Wikipedia, the <a href="../../../../en/s/i/g/WP%7ESIGN_543d.html" class="extiw" title="en:WP:SIGN">Wikipedia Signpost</a> comes out every week. The writers and the publisher thought it would be a good idea to gather news sources from other languages. I understand some weeks, (the paper is published every Monday), there might not be any coverage for the Simple English Wikipedia but if you take the job try to get all news sources to <a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETreebark_5ddb.html" title="User talk:Treebark">here</a> by Saturday evening.

<dd>Hey Archer7, though I agree that we're too small for a Signpost of our own, I wouldn't say that <i>nothing</i> ever happens here. I think the whole Netoholic issue is something, and the blowup with the block was at least somewhat newsworthy. I still think something must be done about him. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cromwellt_f6b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cromwellt">contribs</a> 01:05, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Archer7, I think I've came up with an idea of a draft "proposed" policy on how to become a sysop. Cuz when I saw a list who attempted to be an admin, they've failed due to lack of experience of # of edits, unpopularity, or something like that; so here's my idea. All I'm asking is your opinion about it since I'm no sysop here.</p>
<p>Draft:</p>
<p><i>"A user that wishes to be an administrator in the Simple Wikipedia, (a) must have a minimum experience of 4 to 5 months, (b) must have a minimum of 500+ number of edits, (c) and must have proved to be trusted on handaling admin tasks (example; reverting vandalism, greeting and helping other users, defending the wiki from vandals and users who repeatedly despited warned, give bad-faith edits, etc.,). In addition, he or she must qualify for at least two of these expected criteria in order to be an administrator and all candidates must have at least 2/3 of votes that says "support"."</i></p>

<dd>I get what you mean, but other wikis have their own policies like <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Administrators" class="extiw" title="commons:Administrators">Commons:Administrators</a> to be sysops so I was also suggesting on for this community. In addition, maybe I would agree and reduce the time of experience to a minimum 3 months or 90 days. But when you said for a minimum of 1000 edits, I find that way too much number of edits and since this isn't the English Wikipediam. Wikicommons have a minimum edits of 200 edits instead. Well now whats your opinion? --<a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">§</a> <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlastor_Moody_bdf3.html" title="User:Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a> <sub>(<a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlastor_Moody_93d5.html" title="User talk:Alastor Moody">T</a> + <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alastor_Moody_3295.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alastor Moody">C</a>)</sub> 03:50, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I noticed that you tagged Hemingway as a "Very good article" (back in february), but the article has been tagged "cleanup" for over a year. These seem to be inconsistent. I personally don't think that the article needs cleanup, but was just wondering if there was a reason that you tagged it without removing the cleanup tag? Was it an oversight?

<p>I am amused that you feel like you can make actions opposing mine, when you can't even find the time to make more than 0-4 edits per day here. If all you are going to do is pop in every couple of days to stick up for other non-contributing editors like yourself by either unblocking them or reversing my deletions, you will find that your position will not be one of strength. I cannot support allowing Simple English to become more of playground for disaffected editors from the more successful wikis. That is the challenge we are facing. If you were a responsible admin, you would see that. Since you can't - that means that you either should turn back down your adminship, or at the very least stop sending mixed signals to bad editors by provoking in-fighting. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 16:10, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"Threatening users with blocks simply because they don't comply with your view of the perfect editor is not acceptable."</i> What's even more unacceptable is to <a href="../../../../en/s/t/r/Straw_man.html" class="extiw" title="en:Straw_man">re-phrase what I've said and attempt to refute that</a>, rahter than my actual position. I'm not going to block people for being "imperfect" - I'm going to block them when I see them using our Foundation's resources for their own social networking and entertainment. Play chess on a page - get warned, then blocked. Right now, particularly surrounding Esperanza, there is a community of non-contributory members who piddle around rather than actually contribute. I was tempted to just delete Esperanza altogether, but I'm hoping you or Billz will show some REAL leadership there. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 18:53, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>"What about threatening Alastor Moody with a block just because he didn't have enough edits in the article namespace?"</i> - Again, please don't inaccurately paraphrase me. Did you actually read <a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlastor_Moody_93d5.html#Warning" title="User talk:Alastor Moody">User talk:Alastor Moody#Warning</a>? his number of edits was not reason for the warning. The warning was based on his ratio of article edits to his random other pursuits. I have deleted perhaps 2-3 dozen of non-article pages he created. He makes extra work for me. He picks on newbies by calling tests and comments "vandalism" when they are not. He has <a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlastor_Moody_93d5.html#Your_message_to_User_talk:Chacor" title="User talk:Alastor Moody">picked fights with other editors</a>.

<p>Dear <b>Archer7</b>, since Netoholic is desysopped, will the veto he placed on me be still in place? If so, does that mean that I will be granted sysop access? Or must I have another Rfa to reach consencus? I am rather confused. It's okay. With or without the mop, I can still work here. Just give me a reply soon.
