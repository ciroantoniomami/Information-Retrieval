	    <p>I think there needs to be sources cited for lots of the facts in this article. I am not disputing the facts but for instance the following statements need some sources to back them up:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The medicines do not cost that much money to make. But the corporations (businesses) that make them charge more than the cost for the medicine. They say that they need money to do research to find and make new drugs for AIDS. But the money they charge for the drugs in wealthy countries like France and Canada can pay for the cost of research to find new medicines."</li>

I don't know how this could be proved because it would be up to the drug company to say if it was enough. They might also be disputing the "do not cost much money to make" part 216.56.27.87 22:04, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, as it stands its not so much that people want the drug companies to sell cheap meds in Africa, but rather <i>not</i> go after generic manufacturers for patent violations (Of course only manufacturers that exclusively sell their drug in the 3rd world at a lower cost.) But they <i>do</i> pursue these manufacturers.</dd>

<dd>The issue is this: People cannot afford branded versions of a lifesaving drug in the 3rd world. So governments (like Cuba and Brazil) manufacture this drug for use by impoverished people (in their own countries and in Africa and Asia.) Then the pharmaceutical companies try to stop this manufacture (using WTO clout) based on the idea that it is a patent violation. But these manufacturers are unwilling to actually produce a cheaper product for the 3rd world.</dd>

<dd>I did not go into detail about the basic underlying ideas as this is SimpleEnglish, but I did link to the WHO site which contains many of the details. I could have linked to Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders) <a href="http://www.accessmed-msf.org/index.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.accessmed-msf.org/index.asp" rel="nofollow">Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines</a> which give a much more detailed description of the actions of the drug manufacturers which pulls few if any punches. MSF has a reputation for being more defiant when dealing with this. From a Wall Street Journal article about their activities: “Doctors Without Borders, the Nobel-Prize winning humanitarian group, has defied South African patent law by importing inexpensive generic AIDS drugs manufactured in Brazil for use in a township clinic outside of Capetown. ...By importing the cheaper generic drugs, 'we could be sued for patent infringement,' acknowledged Toby Kasper, a spokesman for Doctors Without Borders. ...he added, 'We are not going to stand for a situation where we would be able to treat twice as many patients as we could by using only patented drugs. As medical professionals, it is our obligation to put the lives of our patients first.' “</dd>

<dd>Again, this is something about which there is not much dispute with regards to the facts. It is simply the readers interpretation of those fact that is at issue. And I tried to scrupulously avoid any interpretation. I just presented the views of people like MSF and the drug companies. Its just that 'we will lose money if the drugs get back to the US and Europe' sound pretty weak when compared to the justifications about saving lives like those of groups like MSF. Part of NPOV is presenting both sides beliefs when there is a contentious issue. I believe I have done this. Unless there is another POV from the drug companies (or other interested parties) that you think should be included. That is, I can write an article about the Holocaust and include information about Holocaust deniers. But that does not mean that their views are going to seem reasonable to a reasonable person when presented along side of historically accurate information. -<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 23:13, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"But there are some people who do not want people to know about condoms or clean needles. They do not want people to have condoms or clean needles. They believe that if people know about condoms and have condoms they will have more sex. They believe that if people have clean needles they will use illegal drugs more. Many of these people think this because of their religion. For example, the Catholic church does not want people to have or use condoms. They do not want people to have condoms because they do not think people should have sex unless they are married. But they think that even married people should not use condoms. They think that if people have sex, it should only be to make a baby."</li>

<dd>However, while I <i>could</i> see someone who does not closely read the news might not be aware of the pharmaceutical companies' view on generic sales in the third world, this is not the same.

<dd>And do not mistake incredulity for being 'snippy'. You have made the complaint that my editing is NPOV. While there are two places (below) where I asking for sources is at least legitimate, asking for sources about this very common knowledge which needs no sources (like that the US is at war with Iraq or that C. Rice is the US SoS) is either one of two things:
<ul>
<li>You are intentionally playing dumb about information of which you are well aware. You are doing this to justify the NPOV tag that you placed - because you do not like the <i>conclusion</i> reached. Then you complain that you are being persecuted when when the fact that the information you requested is described as extremely common knowledge.</li>

I mean c'mon, that defines the term nit-picking. Asking for studies that show that needle-exchange programs are effective is one thing. Asking for a source that the Vatican is anti-Condom is ludicrous.

<li>You genuinely have been under a rock for the past decade and have no clue that the Vatican has taken a <i>loud</i>, <i>repeated</i>, and <i>strong</i> stance against the use of condoms as a sin. If that is the case, you should really acquire some basic knowledge about the subject before you claim that an article is NPOV. Otherwise you violate the WP tenet of <i>assume good faith</i>. (i.e. assume that the author did write what is true unless you have some evidence otherwise. One can safely assume that if you didn't know this very public stance of the use of condoms by the Vatican, that you wouldn't have contradictory information. Like if you knew Cheney was the VPOTUS, you'd know that Bush was the POTUS.) -<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 17:42, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"But when scientists study (look at and learn about) people who use condoms and safe needles they see something different. They see that if teenagers (children 13-19) learn about condoms (and other birth control) they have less sex. And they start having sex later. They also have safer sex. (Safe sex mean doing things to not get pregnant and not get sexually transmitted diseases like HIV, gonorrhea, and syphilis.</li>

<dl>
<dd>I changed the wording a little, because there are studies that say that kids who get real safe sex ed have sex later than their counterparts and some that says they have it at about the same time. (None say that they have sex earlier.) From a scientific/statistical view this suggests that there is an effect, but that it is a small one (making the studies that showed no difference vulnerable to a type 2 errors.) However, I gather you will pick that one to death. And in my experience people never seem to grasp the idea that if of 100 (reasonably well done) studies, 50 show a positive difference, 50 show no difference, and 0 show a negative difference, then a positive difference almost certainly exists. That has always seemed patently obvious to me, but I have learned to accept that people don't do statistics well. So I will bite that and change the wording to 'no dif' in the interests of not getting pecked to death.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>First I would like to know what you mean by "real safe sex ed". <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallSack_695e.html" title="User:BallSack">BallSack</a> 12:39, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That should be patently obvious after reading the information in the article: sex ed that teaches about <i>real</i> measures one can take to keep oneself safer from STDs and pregnancy - like condoms. That is, the opposite of abstinence-only education which, as is demonstrated in the studies that I quoted (and many more) is associated with <i>increases</i> in unsafe sex.-<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 17:42, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe this should be re-worded so that it does not give the impression that one teaching is more "real" than another teaching, because you have to admit that 1) there are many people who consider this "abstinence-only" thing a real way of teaching, and 2) obviously abstinence is 100% effective because they aren't having sex (well only if they follow the teaching and don't actually have sex that is) 216.56.27.87 22:04, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Playing innocent when your intentions are perfectly clear demonstrates a lack of intellectual honesty. Or is it that you are <i>still</i> really suggesting that you were <i>totally unaware</i> that the Vatican takes a hard line stance against the use of birth control, and especially condoms? A search of google news shows over a hundred hits in the past month when you search for Vatican and Birth Control. In fact if you search regular google for condom and Vatican, the first article you get is “EU criticises Vatican's condom 'bigotry'” in which European Commissioner Poul Nielsen states: “They are hurting and bringing into great danger the lives of millions out there.“</dd>

<p>BallSack, you have cited a bunch of articles, with an average word count of 35. Few of which have categories or iw links (unless added by others.) Of course this is <i>not bad</i> at all. Its certainly good to add stubs of articles... I certainly have added many stubs to help lose red links. However, in context of the time you've devoted to bitch, ho, schlong, cunt, and shit it is less impressive. Not that I think those words don't belong in an encyclopedia. I think most certainly they do. I am simply incredulous of your motives <i>here</i> based on that.</p>
<p>I mean its just <i>a bit</i> disingenuous to complain that a large article with this much information, illustrations, iw links, categories, work on making red links blue, etc doesn't <i>reference the Vatican's anti-contraception stance</i>, when you can't even categorize or link your eight word stub for <a href="../../../w/h/o/Whore.html" title="Whore">whore</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, complaining that something isn't NPOV and <i>not</i> giving the <i>other</i> POV that you see as missing simply is not very useful. You need to state that POV to be helpful.</p>
<p>And you did not put that picture on the commons. However, it well illustrates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppet" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppet" rel="nofollow">your actions</a> here.-<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 01:15, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I am sorry that my contributions to Wikipedia are not up to your standards. You must run the place, or something. What on earth is your problem with people trying to contribute to wiki? Do you pull this stuff on all new contributors to wiki? Or have you singled out me for this treatment because I <i>dared</i> to ask for sources on a controversial subject? <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallSack_695e.html" title="User:BallSack">BallSack</a> 02:22, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not at all. But lets honestly look at your four complaints. Two I addressed with citations. Two I said were bogus. (Which they were.) You still haven't explained how you manage to be an educated person who has access to the internet who hasn't heard even of the Vatican's stance on condoms. As I said, a thirteen year old contributor here knows that. Its in the papers every day. Yet that seems to have eluded you? Huh? How is that again?</p>
<p>Because if you already knew that (which I <b>strongly</b> suspect despite your claims of ignorance on that point), why flag the article as NPOV rather than just putting a link to the Vatican's website? Why flag the article as NPOV because of a point that you know to be true? Why not just add to the article and link to it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Because I did not know this to be common knowledge, and furthermore can't <i>find</i> it. Although everyone says that the vatican does not allow condom use no matter what, I have yet through google searching and vatican website searching to find the actual document that says this. And I figured since whoever wrote the article is the "expert" they would know where to find this. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallSack_695e.html" title="User:BallSack">BallSack</a> 03:25, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Or if you have some contrary knowledge, please tell us. I'd be very eager to learn the Vatican had changed its stance. Hell, I'd be happy for you to be able to rub that in my face simply because I would rather eat a little crow and see hundreds of thousands of innocent lives saved.</p>
<p>But as I said I suspect it is the case that you knew very well what the RCC thinks about condoms. But I think you read this article and said 'what a load of liberal crap' because of the implications. So you picked points from the areas that you saw as 'too PC' and then put them here claiming they were unsupported.</p>
<p>And I think if anything you are a little pissed that I read you pretty well. If I got the age right, it was just a good guess. The rest comes through in your edits. And the sock was classic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know what you mean by "comes through in your edits" but you should realize that not you, not anyone, is perfectly neutral in anything and you should not get so defensive when someone questions whether something you wrote is tainted by a bias or not. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallSack_695e.html" title="User:BallSack">BallSack</a> 03:25, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But as I said, you have done some good work. Just stick to things that are legitimate points. You could have made those two points and <i>many</i> of the edits that you have made here without grasping at straws about the Vatican/Condom issue, or making posts with a sock. (Remember, part of Objectivism is about scrupulous honesty.)-<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 02:50, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some of your edits were actually good. You obviously can contribute a lot to this wikipedia... just try to make it positive.

<p>I also added a qualifier about the duration of patents and the meaning of this with regards to antivirals. (If you'd like a source, its from the USPTO.) And I didn't go into the myriad of ways that pharma companies elude this mark (in the US and internationally) to extend the duration of the patent or to market derivative drugs (see: Desloratidine for an example.)-<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 01:38, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, this article is not about CS. However that illustrates a very pertinent point. Saying that the mainstream views are what <i>Scientists</i> believe is not inappropriate. For example, it is OK to say that 'scientists believe' that life on Earth evolved through natural selection of random mutations. This is because that is the mainstream view. Just as is Special Relativity, and Global Warming.

There is a page <a href="../../../s/t/u/Study.html" title="Study">study</a>. But that is the sense of study as in to learn a subject. A 'research study' is a different kind of study, though that could be fixed with a disambiguation on that page. Still the remaining negative of that term is that 'studies show X' is an idiom meaning: 'the preponderance of the evidence done by scientists demonstrates X'.

<dd>That kids taught about condom usage is not disputed. I have quoted you several research articles (including a review) that show this. If you have a paper published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature to dispute this, please post it. Otherwise stop with all the unneeded qualifiers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The issue on which people have some disagreement is what effect this has on age of first intercourse. The evidence says either there is <i>no effect</i> or a small effect that kids taught safe sex have first intercourse later. That is not the sentence you changed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The condom stuff is fine, but the percentage you quoted is way more of an over-simplification than any issue you have about 'most' scientists or whatever. With any contraceptive method, there is a rate for <i>ideal</i> and <i>actual</i> usage. There is a difference, and you need to discuss this. Also you are referring only to peno-vaginal intercourse. There are different rates of effectiveness depending on the kind of sex. Moreover the protective effect of condoms varies based on the disease you are talking about. So grouping <i>STDs</i> together and saying condoms help you not get them is fine. Giving an overall number is a gross over simplification. And you want it as simple as possible, but no simpler. I would lose the percentage. It is enough to use an adjective like <i>very</i> effective.-<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 03:41, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

And now you are dragging someone else into this situation who has nothing to do with it. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallSack_695e.html" title="User:BallSack">BallSack</a> 03:41, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It really bothers me that you keep saying that my edits are not "legitimate", or that they are "negative", or that you accuse me of having some kind of horrible agenda, and constantly talking down to me like you know more than everyone else. It <i>almost</i> makes me want to leave this wikipedia and never come back. Which would be a shame. And all because I asked for some sources on something. I guess I have now learned my "place" on wikipedia and I dare not edit anyone elses article for fear of provoking unsubstantiated claims and accusations against me. Really, I would like an apology for all the horrible things you have said about me, when I have not said a single disparaging word against you and merely asked for citations. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallSack_695e.html" title="User:BallSack">BallSack</a> 03:34, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Stop using the sock and I will never again mention it. But don't deny the obvious. Its called the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence. And I did not insult you, I simply described you very well and you got upset because I did this and caught you using a sock. And I note that we still haven't heard how it is that you simply didn't hear anything about the RCC's stance on condom usage. The righteous indignation would sound a little better if you could perhaps answer that question. How had you not heard about the RCC's stance on condoms?-<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 03:48, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are sources that I have already cited here in this article that show this finding. However there is no study that shows what you suggest - a study of the views of biologists. However that can be inferred from the preponderance of the literature. -<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 15:43, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As soon as you cite me a source that physicists believe in special relativity.</p>
<p>What you are making is called a non-falsifiable argument, and it is a logical fallacy. That is, even if I cited every single research paper in the medical literature that studied this phenomenon, you would still not accept that as a valid proof because there might be a 'scientist' lurking in his basement who doesn't agree with this.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have offered significant evidence of the scientific literature on this subject. You have offered: 0. And medline is there for you, should you decide to start reading the literature on this as I do. So its not up to me to prove that Santa Claus doesn't exist, it is up to you to prove that he <i>does</i>.-<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 06:18, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When will you finally realize that I am not trying to discredit you, or AIDS, or anything, I just wanted some sources added to the article!

<dd>Fine, tell you what. I'll just put both references that I have already cited in the article, you just answer one question I've had from the beginning - as a good faith indication of your eagerness to help this article: <i>Were you or were you not aware that the Vatican was anti-contraception a week ago?</i> -<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">NickGorton</a> 15:43, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmmm, apparently that's the standard here alright. I had to add the footnote templates.

<dd>I should be in bed.... but I had to peek one last time. If you enter those titles into PubMed, you can find the article in queestion and the abstract.
