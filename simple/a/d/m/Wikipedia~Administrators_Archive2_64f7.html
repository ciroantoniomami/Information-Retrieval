<li>Just to clarify, I would originally believe that the editor should receive the sysop tools, although I would be cautious in doing so; unfortunately, the concerns in this section (not to mention oppose) are of far to great a volume to support. Administrators require trust from the community and while that trust should not be sourced from other wikis, it is clear there is still bad blood at simple - an unacceptable trait in an administrator charged with protecting the Wiki through blocks, page protects and deletions. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_cfc_934f.html" title="User:Anthony cfc"><span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">Anthony</span><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">cfc</span></a> <sup>[<a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAnthony_cfc_db71.html" title="User talk:Anthony cfc">T</a> • <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_cfc_Contact_c463.html" title="User:Anthony cfc/Contact">C</a>]</sup> 00:43, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>My opinion on those links is that a lot of it isn't really that serious, and I think his rather distinctive attitude may be causing a few people to misinterpret his comments. That could of course become a problem over here. The block threat was inappropriate, and there are obviously some civility issues at times, but I seriously doubt whether it's going to actually become a problem over here. <i><a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">Archer7</a> - <a href="../../../a/r/c/User_talk%7EArcher7_d9a3.html" title="User talk:Archer7">talk</a></i> 12:02, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Simple answer to the revert on my user talk page is, everybody is allowed to remove content from their own user talk page so I didn't do anything wrong. As for the incivility that followed, again there is no policy saying I have to like everybody and if you see other interactions between myself and Majorly since our friendship broke down, you'll see that for him to get involved in my problems unnecessarily and a generally vindictive attitude towards me is the norm, even if it is likely to create incivility (see <a href="../../../../en/a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive63_a3a3.html" class="extiw" title="en:Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Archive63">this discussion</a>; my user page deletion log, <a href="../../../../en/j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_0207_5437.html" class="extiw" title="en:User_talk:J_Di/0207">this discussion</a> and Majorly's comment <a href="../../../../en/j/i/g/User_talk%7EJigs41793_a80f.html" class="extiw" title="en:User_talk:Jigs41793">here</a>; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:J_Di/1206&amp;oldid=94968054#Use_of_rollback_button" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:J_Di/1206&amp;oldid=94968054#Use_of_rollback_button" rel="nofollow">this discussion</a>; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Majorly&amp;oldid=95110359" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Majorly&amp;oldid=95110359" rel="nofollow">this partial posting of private logs that misrepresented a situation</a>).

<li>I did not think the block "threat" was unnecessary; the user I "threatened" had moved a page using copy and paste twice and my "threat" was preventative, so that they wouldn't do it again. The user was not blocked.</li>
<li>Shaggy9872004 and I have had many previous interactions, and I wouldn't have called them a new user at the time. I was civil with them and tried to help them, but the user was quite uncivil to me before I was the slightest bit uncivil towards them.

<p>I'll admit there is occasional incivility, but it's only in a few cases. In the large majority of cases, I am able to remain civil, and I have never used administrator rights to benefit myself (except in my own user space). That said, I can understand that these comments are likely to change people's minds, and this one here may well have an adverse effect, but at the end of the day me not being an administrator here isn't going to be the end of the world and I can always try again at a later date, when people's opinion of me have changed for the better. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">J Di</a> 13:31, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Zephyr2k suggested on my talk page a few days ago that I run for bureaucrat. I have been an admin since last March 7. While I disdain politics, I have become convinced that we do need a couple more bureaucrats, as well as more admins on the project. I keep my eye on the RC fairly often while I do other computer work, usually anywhere between roughly 7 AM and 10 PM. Note, I have never used my admin power in any content dispute, other than with blatant vandals. I feel that if we can harness the category system usefully, we could have a lot of useful potential toward our goal as a useful "everyman's" encyclopedia. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 21:32, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The simple community has always been a wonderful place to work - much less stressful than English, my main project, and much more inviting. The most appealing characteristic of simple.wikipedia is the fact that it is so much more about writing an encyclopedia than policy debates or Requests for Arbitrations. In all, it's a welcome break from the rather heavy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:WP:DR" class="extiw" title="w:en:WP:DR">DR</a> work I do there.</p>
<p>However, simple is growing - fast. The volume of vandals commuting between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Main_Page" class="extiw" title="w:en:Main_Page">wikipedia.english</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">here</a> is growing every day, yet the response time of our administrator team hasn't; a possible problem. The solution is - more Wikipedians equipped with the block, protection and deletion buttons.</p>
<p>My opinion is .. yes - I could do that. The community could trust me to promptly attend to Admin Noticeboard requests; to keep an eye on the vandal inputs - and all the while, continue Wikipedian duties: simplify articles, expand and cite others, and collaborate with my fellow editors I've grown to love.</p>
<p>This section is in response to a question below: how would you help out with the extra buttons? My main focus would be prompt deletions on VfDs that the community concensus tells us to get rid of; interpreting concensus has always been one of my strong points. Speedy deletes is yet another focus - chances are, I'll have <a href="../../../q/u/i/Category%7EQuick_deletion_requests_afed.html" title="Category:Quick deletion requests">Category:Quick deletion requests</a> open in another FireFox tab <tt>:)</tt> if there's any admins watching, Reconstruction has been tagged since 8pm. I also plan to do a medium-to-large-scale overhaul of this page, with some help from my friends on here, including simplifying the voting process, and an automatic form for nominations.</p>
<p>Next up, I'd use the block tool whenever it comes to that sad event we have to lock somebody from editing, for the good of the encyclopedia; I'd use this when necessary, and when the appropiate warning templates have been added. The page protection tool would come in handy during US school hours, when several high-profile pages get replaced by "poop".</p>
<p>I'd also be able to deal with incidents such as <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVandalism_in_progress&amp;diff=339275&amp;oldid=339273" class="external text" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVandalism_in_progress&amp;diff=339275&amp;oldid=339273" rel="nofollow">this</a> immediately, and without further harm to the encyclopedia.</p>
<p>To summarise, I would use my tools to help this project - to provide a pillar for the newer users; to provide a second opinion to my fellow Wikipedians that have the buttons but faced with a sticky situation. Therefore, I'd like each Wikipedian to first ask themselves...</p>

<li><b>Oppose</b> - I think in general you are doing good work, but you should do more of it. Wikipedia is not a forum; therefore most edits should be changing articles, or talking about how to change articles. Adminship is about the community trusting you, and relying on you to do good work. To get to there, you first need to be noticed; then you need to work on your image as an editor worthy to merit the trust of the community. It is for this reason, mostly, that there is this guideline of 3 months with the project, or 1.000 edits (presumably in the main article space). So in short: do more of what you are doing at the moment, focus a little more on the main article space, and try again once you have around 1.000 edits there. Please do not see it as a setback; I was also refused on my first appilcation. --<a href="../../../e/p/t/User%7EEptalon_a472.html" title="User:Eptalon">Eptalon</a> 11:05, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I know I've only been contributing heavily for the last nineteen days, and I saw people on <a href="../../../s/t/_/WP%7EST_377a.html" title="WP:ST">WP:ST</a> saying their minimums are three months and 1000 edits so I know my chances of this succeeding are pretty slim at this point, but this wiki doesn't have many active administrators and I'm active a lot so I'd be able to help out quite a bit. I'm an administrator on English Wikipedia, so I know about how everything works. I'm pretty good with English Wikipedia's policies, and I've read a bit of the stuff here too. Because of how active I am, I'd be able to deal with quick deletions and vandals quickly.</p>
<p>I'm not actually expecting this to pass, and if it doesn't, I'll understand; it seems unlikely that the community would be able to trust a user enough in less than a month to give them the administrator tools.

<li><b>Oppose</b>: Not particularly pleased with a few edits he has made. He probably intentionally uses the admin tools for fun and not for good purposes, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Damien_Leith&amp;diff=90407691&amp;oldid=90407312" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Damien_Leith&amp;diff=90407691&amp;oldid=90407312" rel="nofollow">in this instance</a> on English wiki - the merge discussion was already closed at the time, so just deliberately reverting edits using the admin tools isn't good, I think. Also in Simple wiki, I don't know what he was trying to do <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cell_wall&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=253515" class="external text" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cell_wall&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=253515" rel="nofollow">with this revert</a> here. I don't think it's right to just use the popup tools for fun.

<ul>
<li>I don't appreciate being told that my edits were <i>probably</i> made in bad faith. If anybody has a problem with an edit I make or something I do, I'd rather they ask me about it as soon as they notice it rather than wait for a forum where they can accuse me of bad faith actions, some of which I don't even remember doing. Administrator rollback isn't easy to stop once the button is clicked, and I have clicked it by accident a few times; it's an easy thing to do. I've even reverted a few anti-vandalism bots by accident and been warned by them. I remember the revert on <a href="../../../../en/d/a/m/Damien_Leith_60ef.html" class="extiw" title="en:Damien_Leith">en:Damien Leith</a>, and I reverted it as quickly as I could. It was an accident, and for what it's worth, I was a bit panicky after I realised I had clicked it. As for the edit to <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_wall.html" title="Cell wall">cell wall</a>, I don't remember making it, but it was most likely a mistake; why would I revert your edit to the next last good revision when your edit had already removed the vandalism? I'm pretty sure I was acting in good faith anyway, as I apparently warned the vandal after I made that edit. That you don't trust me is fine; I wasn't expecting many people to after nineteen days, but I wasn't expecting this at all and I'm saddened by the fact that you think I don't take my responsibilities on English Wikipedia seriously. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">J Di</a> 09:28, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you reverted by accident, you could have said sorry when you reverted it back. That is why I do not think you use your tools well. It looked like you were just using the tools for your own pleasure. Why not next time you could use a bit of politeness, because I wasn't very happy after you used the admin tools like that.

The reason why I want to become a sysop so bad is because I think it is the best way to help wikipedia simple english because right now I have run out of ideas for articles so I will not be editing as much, I still want to help out around here so I decided to run to be a sysop. Another reason why you should vote for me is because I am friendly most of the time.

<dd><b>Question.</b> What makes this different to yesterday's RfA? You asked me to close it early, I did, and now it's back. Yesterday you managed 5 oppose votes in about two hours, it's not going to change today. Tdxiang's suggestion of 3 months is a very good one: you will most likely not get supports with much less than that. <i><a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcher7_b289.html" title="User:Archer7">Archer7</a> - <a href="../../../a/r/c/User_talk%7EArcher7_d9a3.html" title="User talk:Archer7">talk</a></i> 22:31, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Answer</b>It is because I hade time to study, and get to know guidlines and policies. When i started yesterday I said things that were against wikipedia policies, and spammed peoples talk pages and that is some reasons why people opposed me. I had you close it because I wanted time to learn policies and I did so I am trying to become a sysop again. The reason why I want to be a sysop is because I am running out of ideas for articles but I still want to help.

<li><i>(edit conflict)</i> <b>Oppose</b> because the user has spammed heaps of user talk pages about this nomination.

<li>Except some brief delays in promotion, I have performed <b>as a bureaucrat</b> with no complaints until M7 has decided to persue this campaign against me after I made a judgement call and chose not to promote <a href="../../../t/d/x/User%7ETdxiang_efc6.html" title="User:Tdxiang">User:Tdxiang</a>. These sorts of judgement calls happen occassionally, and should not be used to attack the person put in the position of making that call.

<li>There is little chance of people reconfirming me since this trouble is all so recent. Reconfirmation of sysops is a bad idea because that job attract criticism over time. Apparently, my removal is the reward for putting over two years of hard admin and bureacrat work into this wiki - that it all can be shattered in the matter of one week. So, to all you ambitious ones, enjoy it while it lasts. I would suggest staying away from making bold, hard decisions, as you will end up being punished for them. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 23:40, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b>. Simple WP wouldn't have been better off if Netoholic had taken a wikibreak at the peak of the conflict until the issues die out. But he stayed on with the project and continued with his responsibilities to clean up the site despite this. However, the block on M7 is unjustified and constitutes an abuse of power whichever way you look at it. Thus, I cannot give him a 'keep', but at the same time, cannot give a 'remove'. <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZephyr2k_5b2b.html" title="User:Zephyr2k"><font color="#FF69B4"><b>zephyr2k</b></font></a> 23:12, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
