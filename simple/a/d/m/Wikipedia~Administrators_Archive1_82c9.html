<p>I would like to do a self nomination for adminship. Here are my reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I normally work at hours when acitve admins are offline. As such, vandals strike and I would need blocking tools and rollback for efficient anti-vandalism operations.</li>
<li>When <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">Requests for deletion</a> reach a concensus, deletion is necessary for nonsense articles. Also, spamming is a problem here, which makes the tools come in handy.</li>
<li>I have been here for six months, helping out with the cleaning up of articles and wikification.</li>
</ol>

<li><b>Oppose</b> - Just today hit 1000 edits, a fact you made sure to <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Tdxiang&amp;dbname=simplewiki_p" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Tdxiang&amp;dbname=simplewiki_p" rel="nofollow">note</a> about 15 minutes before posting this self-nomination.

<dd><b>Answer</b>: Core articles are recommended for Simple as we want people who have little understanding of English to be able to comprehend what we are trying to put through. the reason for creating <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anus_language.html" title="Anus language">Anus language</a> is because we already have an <a href="../../../../en/a/n/u/Anus_language.html" class="extiw" title="en:Anus_language">article</a> on English Wikipedia.

<dd><b>Answer</b>: Rollback, like I mentioned earlier, is a tool for quick reversion of vandalism. Blocking is also one other way. I am familiar with Wiki markup and I also hope to clear any doubts, as an admin, about existing policies involved in Simple English Wikipedia. As for the timeslot, I cannot assure a definite one. in the event of unforseen circumstances, I will be offline. However, I will still be on when I am available, so you don't have to worry too much about this one. I hope I have cleared any doubts here. <tt>:)</tt>-- <a href="../../../t/d/x/User%7ETdxiang_efc6.html" title="User:Tdxiang"><font color="#E32636">Tdxi</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#006600">an</font></a><a href="../../../t/d/x/User_talk%7ETdxiang_cfb1.html" title="User talk:Tdxiang"><font color="gold">g</font></a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Tdxiang_07fb.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Tdxiang">@</a> 09:24, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Oppose</b> A currently active user that is a great asset to the simple wp community. However, an admin should know when it is necessary to post an article tagged for deletion to <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a> and when it is not necessary. The article "The Reluctant Dragon" which I tagged for deletion didn't have to be posted at RFD since it was nonsense <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_deletion&amp;diff=211402&amp;oldid=210791" class="external autonumber" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_deletion&amp;diff=211402&amp;oldid=210791" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZephyr2k&amp;diff=211403&amp;oldid=210124" class="external autonumber" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZephyr2k&amp;diff=211403&amp;oldid=210124" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It was not an unusual circumstance and until now, I cannot imagine a discussion coming out from an RFD of that article or similar to it. It couldn't even pass for a stub. I'll probably support a future RFA, but not yet. <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZephyr2k_5b2b.html" title="User:Zephyr2k"><font color="#FF69B4"><b>zephyr2k</b></font></a> 00:54, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Oppose</b></s> <b>Neutral</b> For much the same reason as Zephyr2k, as I have also tagged nonsense posts for deletion and received comments about RFD. Also while it could be due to the excessive number of recent edits, but there have been some questionable edits (Piping the link [[America|American]] without noticing that the page linked to was a redirect as well as not the correct page as context indicates, tagging a page for immediate delete without checking history and noticing it just needed reverted - did check after the edit and re-edited the revert, his edit of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jose_Rizal_7188.html" title="Jose Rizal">Jose Rizal</a> makes me wonder if he thought that was all he thought the article needed.) The high volume of recent edits, questionable edits, RfD issues all makes me wonder if he is ready for the position at this time and is over extending himself in the goal of quantity over quality to get admin. <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreol_5a8b.html" title="User:Creol">Creol</a> 01:24, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dear Creol, I understand your concerns over these matters concerning Rfds. However, I would like to assure you that such loopholes in my work were accidental and that I work for the quality, not the quantity. I understand your concerns about consistency in my work. However, take a look at my other edits and you would realise that I have not left out any other things in editing. Yes, there has been a phrase saying "In this life, you're either consistent or you're non-existent." I would assure you that I value time and consistency and that my work to articles is the most important. Thank you.-- <a href="../../../t/d/x/User%7ETdxiang_efc6.html" title="User:Tdxiang"><font color="#E32636">Tdxi</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#006600">an</font></a><a href="../../../t/d/x/User_talk%7ETdxiang_cfb1.html" title="User talk:Tdxiang"><font color="gold">g</font></a> <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html#Tdxiang" title="Wikipedia:Administrators"><sup>Adminship</sup></a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Tdxiang_07fb.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Tdxiang">@</a> 02:10, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thank you all for the trust you place in me. I am looking forward towards placing my skills at the hands of the community, should you chose to elect me. My current work schedule permits me to continue editing Wikipedia in the range of what I did the last few months, about 250-500 edits/month. I am looking forward to being able to fight the vandals myself, rather than having to recur to others to block them.

Sometimes when I fight with vandals I never found an admin to help me. I'm a sysop on italian wikipedia, but I believe in this "simple" project. Now there are (13) pages in request in Category:Deletion requests but anyone delete them...</p>

<dd>thanks Zephyr2k for the question, sysop status comports 4 bottons(delete,block,rollback,protected/unprotected) but sometimes I look in some special categories like stub or wikify for done some works, in particular I see that some pages that are segnalated as stub, is a very good article, and sometimes I wikify same page.</dd>

<p>I now feel that it is time for me to apply for administrative privileges in order to block vandals and revert pages faster. I am becoming increasingly frustrated at the amount of vandal attacks on Simple English Wikipedia and the time taken for an administrator to respond, due to the increasing amount of inactive sysops. On many occasions, I have been reverting vandalism for half an hour in a vicious circle, which is causing major disruption to other users, before an administrator blocks them. According to Interiot's tool (<a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Billz&amp;dbname=simplewiki_p" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Billz&amp;dbname=simplewiki_p" rel="nofollow">Here</a>), I have over 3,400 edits on this Wikipedia and have been a editing for nearly four months, which I believe has given me enough experience to use Wikipedia effectively and efficiently. I usually spend between ten and fifteen hours per day here, which can be seen by my large number of edits each day. If I am not on Simple English Wikipedia, I can be contacted by email, which I have set to automatically check for new mail every minute and will give me text and sound notification of incoming messages. I enjoy contributing on Simple English Wikipedia because each day is a new challenge and gives me a great sense of satisfaction. More information about me can be found on my user page. Thank you. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillz_478d.html" title="User:Billz">Billz</a> (<a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBillz_f36c.html" title="User talk:Billz">Talk</a>) 22:25, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Ten to fifteen hours a day?</b> According to that, you spend about 52% of every day on Wikipedia. If I take off 8 hours of sleep, you only spend about 2.5 hours of your time while you are awake <i>away</i> from Wikipedia. 78% of your time awake is on Simple. I'm sorry, but this isn't healthy. You need to go outside sometimes, you'll get RSI, damage your eyes etc. Really, take a break.

I spend this sort of time here because I really enjoy editing and contributing to such a great project.

<dd>I understand that I do spend a lot of time editing and improving Simple English Wikipedia, however this isn't going to change whether I become an administrator or not. During August, I really found my feet here and this is reflected in my high edit count during that month (Over 50 per day on average), but due to internet problems at work, my edit count will be nowhere near the 1580 I clocked up during August. I understand that your vote is your choice, but I will try to keep editing on Simple English Wikipedia whatever happens, so please do not worry about my health.

<dd>Sorry, to say so, I am not really against you becoming an admin; though I know what I am talking about (if you look in the history, you will find my own (failed) application <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators/Archive1#Eptalon" class="external text" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators/Archive1#Eptalon" rel="nofollow">here</a>). During that time I had between 600 and 800 edits/month, or about 20 a day. This was hard to keep up, given that I have a daytime job, and sometimes I go out on weekends. Since then, I have stepped back, and became a happier, though still unprivileged editor). To put it into a nutshell, I'd prefer an admin to be on this wikipedia less, but rather have more of a social life (which also influences on the knolwedge about things one has. This can be important ot see the other side, aka NPOV). In short, I dont stand in your way, if you think you must go ahead. I simply dont feel comfy about the long hours (And I know what I am talking about, I have a computer job as well..). And no, its definitely not about editcount. -- <a href="../../../e/p/t/User%7EEptalon_a472.html" title="User:Eptalon">Eptalon</a> 21:17, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do use computers a lot, but I also do have a great social life when I can. I have a wide circle of friends, from whom I have learned a lot of knowledge about computers, science and maths. I have never put Wikipedia before my social life, because as you can see from my graphs, I do pop in and out for various reasons, whether due to work or other commitments. If I am asked to go out somewhere by a friend, I will try to go where possible and I wouldn't ever think about not going because I have work to do on Simple English Wikipedia. I can totally understand your viewpoint, but I can assure you that I am happy in my life at the same time as helping Simple English Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillz_478d.html" title="User:Billz">Billz</a> (<a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBillz_f36c.html" title="User talk:Billz">Talk</a>) 21:24, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to nominate myself to become an administrator mainly to block vandals, and revert vandalism with a rollback button that actually works (I'm currently using godmode light). I've been here since December 2005, and I've got over 1700 edits according to <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Archer7&amp;dbname=simplewiki_p" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Archer7&amp;dbname=simplewiki_p" rel="nofollow">Interiot's tool</a> and I think I now have a firm idea of how this project is run.

<li><b>Support</b>. A very good, active contributor, who will only be more able and active as an admin. Of course, vandal-blocking isn't the only thing admins do, but it is certainly a valid focus to have. In the same way that edit count should only be a secondary consideration, I think that exactly how long a person has been editing here should also be secondary. This goes for Eptalon, too, of course. If someone has well over 1000 edits, let's not be so worried about time since their first edit. However, the reverse is not true: if someone has been here a long time and has very few edits, that does not reflect a high level of interest in or commitment to the project, so that should be considered as well. Primary considerations (for me) are quality of edits, good faith, sustained interest in the project, and understanding of what being an administrator means and does not mean. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 18:05, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To clarify the raying above: Freshstart sure is a tireless contributor, but his edits seem to focus on fixing what is there.

<li>I will try to answer the questions in a small number of words. The Simple Wikipedia is a special Wikipedia because we make it to help people learn a language that is useful for them. It is its main purpose, but its articles have other utilities, for example, people can use them for make versions in other languages.</li>
<li>A change I would like to see made is the way in which some users help us. These users create many <b>stubs</b> about topics similar to unknown bands and small football teams. They would help more if they create and expand important articles, for example, those of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_articles_all_languages_should_have_e645.html" title="Wikipedia:List of articles all languages should have">What we should have</a> page.</li>

(FWIW, I disagree about the primary function of Simple, but agree that ideally editors would focus on core topics--besides "the list", I see that as being history, world affairs, basic science topics, great thinkers, major historical nations/cultures/languages, and things like that. More pop-culture things like the band-du-jour; every movie, album, and video game or platform ever released; every fictional character/place/thing; etc. are better left to EN, at least until more of the basics are covered.) The stated reasons for being an admin don't really require admin tools, but the edit history shows enuf justified {delete} tags that I think the admin tools would be used constructively. Soliciting votes on admin nominations is frowned on at EN, but I can understand why the low traffic here might be more likely to cause people to resort to it. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 10:40, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ok, my second nomination. While I was on waiting to self-nominate myself again after I had been here a full three months, our recent vandal (and <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a>'s suggestion) has made me speed up my thought process a bit. Ok, according to Kate's tools, I have over <a href="http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits.cgi?user=Ricky81682&amp;dbname=enwiki" class="external text" title="http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits.cgi?user=Ricky81682&amp;dbname=enwiki" rel="nofollow">over 7,200 edits</a> in English and <a href="http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits.cgi?user=Ricky81682&amp;dbname=simplewiki" class="external text" title="http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits.cgi?user=Ricky81682&amp;dbname=simplewiki" rel="nofollow">over 2,500 edits</a> in Simple.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I have a ton of edits in categories, since (as one can see on my user page) I have been trying to organize <a href="../../../y/e/a/Category%7EYears_0e74.html" title="Category:Years">Category:Years</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/r/Category%7EBirths_by_year_6fa7.html" title="Category:Births by year">Category:Births by year</a>, and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Category%7EDeaths_by_year_2179.html" title="Category:Deaths by year">Category:Deaths by year</a>. I did manage to complete the days of the year a while back. I admittedly haven't written a lot of articles. Truthfully, I only wrote <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julian_calendar.html" title="Julian calendar">Julian calendar</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_calendar.html" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a> after noticing a need for them.

He was blocked recently there, and has found a home on Simple: creating dozens of bad articles. He's already vandalized my user page, and has proven himself to be very annoying on the EN: side. With Angela on a wikibreak, and unable to get in contact with the two other active admins, I'm not sure what else to do if this user becomes an even bigger problem. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 01:50, 9 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't seem to be a huge problem. He hasn't created that many articles, and it's debatable whether a sub stub is candidate for speedy deletion anyway. A lot of pages here are substubs, far more so than on the English Wikipedia. If he becomes a bigger problem, just list on vandalism in progress, but since he's not even banned on en at the moment, I don't think we should be auto-deleting everything he does. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 04:48, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, it looks like a few hours later he was unblocked (he came from an AOL proxy). I never suggested that we "auto-delete" everything he added.

<p>I would like to nominate my self to be an admin. I have been a simple wikipedian user since June, and have expanded, improved, and started my own articles. I want them to revert vandalism faster and block users as very recently we have had sysops not on simple and lots of vandalism from Anita934 sockpuppets. I have been an English user since April but stopped in September because I wanted to make simple the wikipedia, I contribute most too. Mostly, I work on the airline articles.

<p>I would like to nominate myself to become an administrator mostly to stop vandalism more efficiently than I can now. I have been here since July 22, but I had been observing the process of using wikipedia beforehand. I have made about 400 edits so far.

<li><b>Weak oppose</b>. We like to have longer than a month, and at least 500-1000 edits, before approving admins. Your edits and vandal fighting are good, though, although it takes practice to try to find the neutral middle ground, putting our personal opinions aside (I am looking at <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&amp;diff=181608&amp;oldid=164718|this" class="external text" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&amp;diff=181608&amp;oldid=164718|this" rel="nofollow">edit</a> for example, where you wrote that Pinochet was a "brutal dictator", it may well be true but it still seems a little 'pov' way of putting it, and the guy is still alive! Maybe better to say he is "considered" a brutal dictator by so-and-so, or something...) I don't think that's a bar to adminship though, goodness knows I have done similar things myself... The important thing is that the power to delete, block and protect not be misused in a content dispute, but only for blatant vandalism or other rule breaking. Let's give it about two more months' worth of edits, then there will be less to object to on grounds of time spent, and I will happily reconsider my vote. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 18:21, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>After being here for a few months, I feel that I have learned and more fully understand the finer points of Simple Wikipedia; therefore, I humbly request to be a sysop for Simple Wikipedia. I am an avid vandal fighter on English Wikipedia, English Wiktionary, and here at Simple Wikipedia. I am a member of the <a href="http://countervandalism.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://countervandalism.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Counter Vandalism Unit</a>. I am a channel staffer at <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/vandalism-simple-wp" class="external text" title="irc://irc.freenode.net/vandalism-simple-wp" rel="nofollow">#vandalism-simple-wp</a>, <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/vandalism-en-wt" class="external text" title="irc://irc.freenode.net/vandalism-en-wt" rel="nofollow">#vandalism-en-wt</a> (the Wiktionary vandalism channel), and <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/vandalism-meta" class="external text" title="irc://irc.freenode.net/vandalism-meta" rel="nofollow">#vandalism-meta</a> (the Meta vandalism channel). For the full picture, I am an op in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/vandalism-en-wp" class="external text" title="irc://irc.freenode.net/vandalism-en-wp" rel="nofollow">#vandalism-en-wp</a> (the WP channel). In addition to CVU bots, I frequently watch for vandalism with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CryptoDerk/CDVF" class="extiw" title="w:User:CryptoDerk/CDVF">CDVF</a>.</p>
<p>I know that my <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Psy_guy&amp;dbname=simplewiki_p" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Psy_guy&amp;dbname=simplewiki_p" rel="nofollow">edit count</a> is relatively low compared to other new admins, but one should note that many of my edits have been speedy deleted after I have posted speedy tags on articles. In addition, I feel I should mention that I am an admin on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Psy_guy" class="extiw" title="w:User:Psy_guy">English Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Psy_guy" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:User:Psy_guy">English Wiktionary</a>. Also, I have already served as an admin on Simple Wikipedia in a temporary capacity <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=rights&amp;user=Suisui&amp;page=User%3APsy+guy%40simplewiki" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=rights&amp;user=Suisui&amp;page=User%3APsy+guy%40simplewiki" rel="nofollow">twice</a>.

I feel that admin rights would assist me in the course of my work and help me to better serve the community.</p>
<p>I completely understand if the community feels that I should be here longer for applying for powers, but I strive to assist the wiki-community. Therefore, I offer myself to you for your consideration. -- <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsy_guy_117a.html" title="User:Psy guy">Psy guy</a> 23:58, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand that I am <b>quite</b> new - on <i>this</i> WikiPedia, but I have been on en wikipedia for aaages now, and have heaps of edits, in the main space, Wiki, Template etc. I do Recent Changes Patrol, New Changes Patrol, I monitor high-profile pages, espech Wikipages (including the Main Page). I am familiar with many Wiki features, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing your Monobook.js page</li>
<li>Reverting Vandalism</li>
<li>Rollback</li>
<li>Banning and Blocking Policys - incuding things like dodgy Usernames etc</li>
<li>Warning Vandals</li>
</ul>
<p>on en:wiki i have Popups, Godmode-light (Rollback), RC Filter,etc and other 'advanced tools'.</p>
<p>In closing, I believe Adminship/sysop status should not be given out on the basis of edit count. There are political and technical arguments against this. The technical side is that adding all users above a certain edit count to an implicit group would require at least one extra query on page view; this could turn into an unreasonable performance demand. There's a workable solution to this, however. On the political side of things; English Wikipeia, and I'm sure this one also, is a wiki where "editcountitis" is discouraged and in some cases, condemned. An edit count is not a valuable indicator of a user's trustworthiness where Adminship/sysop status is concerned, nor is it a good indicator of the value and quality of their contributions.</p>

<dd><b>Oppose</b>. I agree that the edit count should not be the sole thing looked at for the decision on who to grant admin status (or other privileges) to. Things like warning vandals and reverting pages can also be done without being admin. The change of the old layout of simple to the new one was done completely by someone who does not have administrative status (Only for the final commit might they have needed an admin). As of this writing, you have an editcount of 2 (edits probably spent on putting up this request). As to my knowledge, adminship requires working with the project for about three monnths. This is simply to get to know how things work here. I therefore propose you to worki with us, as a normal user. After about 3 months, you come back, if you want, and show us what you have done. This is the basic idea of a meritocracy. -- <a href="../../../e/p/t/User%7EEptalon_a472.html" title="User:Eptalon">Eptalon</a> 10:07, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Neither edit count nor time spent should be the absolute test of admin rights (I think a few excellent users should be granted it earlier), but both are useful in most cases. Three months is a good amount of time, and the edit limit is about 1000 edits.

<p>I know I seem completely new on Simple English Wikipedia, but for about six months I have contributed without a loginname. I have contributed to the userboxes and articles in ENWikipedia (although I am not an admin there). My goals for Simple English Wikipedia is to create Simple English userboxes, simplify articles and to help end vandalism! (The dreaded v-word!). I cannot do much researching as I have internet restriction. I may seem young (13) but dedication, responsibility and ability are the only things that should contribute to being an admin. I know I have little basis for proof as most of my edits are anonymous. If you think I am not credible, then I will try to get credible.</p>

<p>I'd be willing but I can't. Most contributions weren't on this IP. I have like 50 contributions on this at the most. Sorry.

<li><b>Oppose</b>. You don't seem like a horrible candidate. Can you at least tell us what IP that was? If you can, we can at least check the contributions, etc. About how many contributions did you have here on that IP? I am in full agreement with you that age does not ultimately matter for adminstrator's rights. I even think that the time and editcount requirements can be bent at times. But you should be pretty close to both before even thinking about asking for admin rights, normally. The requirements are three months (you've passed that you say, and I believe you) and 1000 edits. Do you really have that many? I think if you can't prove that IP, we're not going to be able to count them for you, since we don't know if those were you, or even if they were good or bad edits. That's one of the reasons we tell anon users to get a username. There is a certain reputation that builds up around a username (plus the contributions can always be checked), so people know if that user is a good one, a poor one, or a vandal. Even though it's a pain, I'd say to get editing, and request admin status again when you've got 1000 edits under this username. If they're all good edits, I can almost guarantee you that you'll make it. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cromwellt_f6b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cromwellt">contris</a> 02:37, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. As I pointed out on meta not long ago, all nominations are by definition political, and all oppose votes are too. I think that Archer7 is an excellent candidate for bureaucrat, since he respects the rights of other users. I admit my bias, since it was my rights he has defended. But that does not lessen the validity of this nomination. Having another bureaucrat or two shouldn't bother you, Netoholic, unless you are desperate to keep that power all to yourself. You nominated yourself for CheckUser ostensibly to avoid power abuses, but you don't want any other project bureaucrats who would prevent that same issue. If I'm wrong about your fear of other bureaucrats, nominate one yourself. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cromwellt_f6b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cromwellt">contris</a> 09:07, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Good contributor and we can certainly use more multi-lingual editors, and I have no problem with the number of edits.

<dd>I don't expect anyone to be <i>faultless</i>. However, I do expect admins to be <b>careful</b>. The Wiki software will silently let you hang yourself, just as readily as C (at least in it's early days--hopefully with modern IDE's you'd at least get some sort of 'are you SURE you want to do that?' warning), at least in part because the problems will come from the data, not the syntax. An example in the MediaWiki world: IP blocking only checks that it is a valid IP address (or range). Transpose a couple digits or mistype a single character, and, instead of blocking the intended vandal in Timbuktu, you've blocked everyone using AOL or some other large ISP. And there will be no error message, and no one will know of the error, until people start complaining.</dd>
<dd>And this edit<a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chernobyl&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112142" class="external autonumber" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chernobyl&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112142" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, made since I raised the concerns above and you responded, seems to indicate that even if you did get an error message (and it is probably my bias from 15+ years as a software <i>tester</i>, but I see counting on the software to catch your errors as a crutch; one that doesn't exist in the MediaWiki software), you would miss it, because you don't appear to look closely at the page after you click Save. <s>(and now that I finally checked, did you realize your self-nom text above contains at least 3 or 4 typos and 1 usage that m-w.com says is correct, but any native English speaker would go "huh?"

<dd>I do not think it is prolific to get into usage patterns of English words. They vary according to socioeconomic background, geographic region, etc. The comment to that edit reads <i>Something stubbable taken from en. Considered intelligible for simple users.</i>. It was a copy-paste operation, the brace left out from the copying was the very first character of the copying. Two minutes later, Archer7 noticed. Three minutes later I was putting in the (supposedly Ukranian) alternate spelling as a redirect, as I had seen that Archer7 was faster. - <a href="../../../e/p/t/User%7EEptalon_a472.html" title="User:Eptalon">Eptalon</a> 14:57, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

And yes, it was a 'copy-paste operation' something which I and Netoholic have REGULARLY chastized you for, since that results in non-simple articles. You seem to believe that putting EN articles here overrides the 'simple' rules, and I believe the opposite, that SIMPLE Eng is the priority here. We can agree to disagree on that,</s> but the enormous qty of typos you introduce/reproduce here has me very concerned, and your stated reliance on the software to catch your errors, even tho' it CAN'T, leaves me DEEPLY concerned. 165.121.26.170 08:48, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, let's keep it down to the facts. Freshstart thinks that based on the many typos I make, and the editing patterns he sees, that I am unfit to hold admin responsibility. He fears that I might mistype an IP address( 10.16.x.y instead of 10.61.x.y, for example). Also he thinks that relying on the computer in those areas that the computer is good at, is wrong. He also thinks that importing articles from English Wikipedia, before actually simplifying them is a wrong approach.

<li><b>Support</b>. Eptalon is a good contributor with a strong desire to help, always acting in good faith. Almost every error and problematic usage on Wikipedia can be corrected. I think the positive effects of having Eptalon as an admin far outweigh any negative ones. I think at least part of his typos, etc., can be explained by his self-nomination at the top: Eptalon edits in free minutes during work, so he/she does not have time to check over it for errors, and (realizing the nature of a wiki) knows that others will come and fix errors later. This is perfectly justifiable, IMO, and because of our appreciation of his/her interest in the project, we should be willing to accept a few minor errors which can later be corrected. I also believe that Eptalon will be more careful with administrative powers. Believe in people and you'll often be justified in that belief. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 18:05, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>did you find any indication that Eptalon intended to be more careful as an admin??? Any acknowledgement in that direction would have kept me from changing my vote, but I certainly didn't see it. As a software tester I have seen many attitudes from developers, and the 'oh, the software will catch my mistakes' is often associated with the developers I write the most bugs against. Software, by design, does what the programmer tells it--nothing more, nothing less; you only have to look at the failed (as in crash and burn--thousands, millions, or billions of dollars wasted) NASA projects to see how critical it is that developers <i>check their <b>own</b> work</i>, and not expect software to catch their errors, to see the problems with that approach. Look at the examples I cited, and see how many fixes were required beyond what I mentioned. <s>'Unapologetically sloppy' will always be 'unapologetically sloppy', in my experience, and Simple has too few editors to try and clean up after other admins' mistakes.</s>165.121.26.170 08:48, 18 March 2006 (UTC) (User:Freshstart, apparently not logged in for some reason.)

<dd>I have no problem with typos, and I regret mentioning 'Simple issues' here as I believe this is not the best forum for such discussions.

<p>Typos are human, yes. To expect other editors (note that the Wikipedia software didn't complain about either broken link--it took the review of a human) seems like 'make-work' for other editors. I don't have a problem with 'typos'--we all make them. I DO have a problem with a consistent pattern of zero percent policing one's edits to avoid the most basic errors, creating extra work others. I have no idea where the "Also he thinks that relying on the computer in those areas that the computer is good at" comes from. The Wikipedia computer/software more than happily accepted Eptalon's broken links (check two versions before--it was only followup human editors (not just me) that detected and fixed Eptalon's errors. Computers will NEVER be as able to detect software errors as humans can.<a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Penguin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114712" class="external autonumber" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Penguin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114712" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>--scroll to the bottom. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 07:30, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I haven't been here that long, but I've been editing the english wikipedia for a while, and have 788 edits there, all abuse-free. I recently found the simple english wikipedia, and I really like the idea a lot. But apparently some don't, with rediculous reasons like "it's not very big". So, I came here to work on it, since that's obviously better then complaining about it. If i became an admin, I would fight vandals, delete junk, and help simplify the interface some more (I still see some things in it that are not that simple).

<dd>It's not so much the number of edits but that is a measure of experience, especially in regards to experience with other wikipedians. An administrator has the ability to block people and protect pages which is not a minor thing and I haven't seen enough edits to know how'd you react if some type of disagreement came up (you'd probably act very well, but still I don't know). Do you understand what I am saying? In regards to vandals and junk, there a lot that can be done, admin or not. On the other hand, what were the interface simplifications you had in mind? -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 03:56, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, look at their talk pages. You don't need admin rights to discuss changing them. I admit, you do need admin rights to change them by itself.

<p>Alright, I am <i>really really annoyed</i>. The Ebonics comment was bad enough, but a spate of vandalism that made me actually put (albeit stubbed) content in <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer_Simpson_8936.html" title="Homer Simpson">Homer Simpson</a> because they were newly made by a vandal is <i>too much</i>. I even had to look up Pokemon on en.</p>
<p>So despite the fact that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I actually said (today in fact) 'why the &lt;expletive deleted&gt; would Phroziac actually want to have to do icky administrative things?'</li>
<li>Several years ago after a year in Dante's Inferno as an administrative chief resident I promised myself that I would never <i>ever</i> have the A-word (well at least not <i>that</i> A-word) after my name,</li>
</ul>
<p>So despite that, whenever I've been her long enough and written enough, I would like to be an admin to stop that when in progress.</p>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure: on the negative side: I must admit though that I am <i>not</i> exceptionally computer savvy. But I have a live-in consultant/boyfriend who is. And I may not be the best luck as an admin. The <i>last</i> time I was an administrator of anything I was the ER admin on call in one of NYC's trauma centers on both days when flight 587 fell out of the sky over Brooklyn and the WTC was destroyed. Though I am certain that <i>nothing</i> will happen to this Wiki... It was coincidence. Really.

<li>Its like that quote from Rebecca West about feminism: “I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat or a prostitute.”</li>

<dd>I am obviously a radical <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queer.html" title="Queer">queer</a> who is pushing the <a href="http://www.bettybowers.com/homoagenda.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bettybowers.com/homoagenda.html" rel="nofollow">homosexual agenda</a> if I say that being gay is about <i>more than just sex</i> or that its bad and wrong to criminalize LGBT people.</dd>

<dd>But then as I said to Ricky previously, I am no longer interested as this seems really more about a popularity contest than anything else. Which is a like the proverbial red rag to a bull for me.

Since I started here (about a week after Ricky) I have <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickGorton_9282.html" title="User:NickGorton">produced just a little more than 1% of the articles on simple and I've expanded quite a few more</a>.

<p>Hi, this is me, Thorpe. I started articles on the main english Wikipedia at the beginning of this year and I have come to find myself making pages here as well. Not only have I created new artcles but I have made a new stub and added various categories. I hope that by making me an administrator I will be able to deal with various problems such as vandalism.</p>
<p>Speaking of vandalism, I noticed quite a few pages were vandalised earlier (around 10 AM) and they didn't even get reverted until I come along and did so just a couple of minutes ago. It shows that we need more active people here. I would also be able to deal with people vandalising quicker if I were able to block certain IP addresses.</p>

<p>I would like to <b>nominate myself</b> for administrator status. I would have been happier if I had been nominated (nominating yourself feels wrong!), but here are my reasons for doing it, and reasons why you should think about voting for me:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>My experience with Wikipedia:</b>
<ul>
<li>I have been a member of the Simple English Wikipedia since October 2003 (see <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarknew_2a23.html" title="User talk:Marknew">my talk page</a>).

<li>That's OK, I'm not taking your views personally! I would agree with your views on number of edits <i>to an extent</i>. Yes, a fairly large number of edits is required to find out how good an editor is, but I also believe that the quality of edits should <i>always</i> be looked at before the quantity (I am not saying that my own edits are brilliant, that's your job - I'm just stating my opinion).</li>

<dd>In the case of this Wikipedia, I realise that my number of edits is a bit low, but I nominated myself because I believe that three active admins on a Wikipedia of this size is not sufficient (I would be happy even if some other (good) people became admins and I did not - my aim is to see the number of admins increase, not boost my ego!).

<dd>Thank you for your comment. I am happy to strenghen my first impression; you will be a good admin, or precisely, better with much experience. Over 1,000 experiences, I meant not only quality of contributions (both article and discussion) but also experiences with other Wikipedians; there are incredibly nasty things between the heaven and the earth. And specially on this wiki some editors seem to lack maturity, so editing experience is important, I think. Your activities are sincere and fine from my view.

<p>Several adminstrator accounts have been inactive for a very long time. These pose a danger to the wiki because someone may try to guess their password. It can also be confusing for people when they want to seek help from an administrator for more immediate help. I (or any future bureaucrat) will likely have no problem re-instating sysop access if they return and ask. Here is a list I propose for removal.</p>

<li>We should block them. They can unblock themselves. Otherwise, if the consequences are dire, desysopping is necessary.

<li>No, blocking them really wouldn't accomplish much because in the event their pw was compromised, the hacker would have the exact same ability to unblock himself. However, I feel the danger posed by this eventuality is infinitessimally small; and as I have pointed out, if someone was going to play 'guess the password' they might go for the bur., active or no. Since all passwords are unique and have billions and billions of alphanumeric permutations, it is too improbable to bother defending against IMO. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 13:04, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with the conception of sysophood as kept on meta.wiki... <i>Sysop-hood is not a lifetime status. Get it if you need it. Keep it if people trust you. Quit it if you do not need it. Lose it if people feel they cannot trust you.</i> Should these people return back to simple.wiki, they can easily re-apply and get admin status back. It is sort of confusing and sometimes can be misleading saying "there are nn administrators", while more than a half can not be seen... I propose that they are <b>de-sysoped</b>, if there is a consensus, but I absolutely do not see any reason for blocking their account. --<a href="../../../m/7/_/User%7EM7_ecdf.html" title="User:M7">M7</a> 20:42, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think there is not much harm that can be done by these inactive people keeping their admin status; provided they have chosen a decent (hard to guess) password for their account. On the other hand, seeing that they are mostly inactive, I think it would make sense to "demote" them to regular users. When they come back, and start editing again, their admin privs can be restored. --- <a href="../../../e/p/t/User%7EEptalon_a472.html" title="User:Eptalon">Eptalon</a> 11:01, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I don't think there's much harm on the Simple English Wikipedia, which has few edits and only a very small number of administrators. The effect would be larger on the English Wikipedia, where there are thousands of edits a day and over a thousand admins - a single compromised admin account could wreck a lot of annoying damage without anybody noticing. Here, we tend to know what happens if we check New changes. In short, I don't think five inactive admin accounts are worth worrying about. - <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETangotango_2487.html" title="User:Tangotango">Tangotango</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETangotango_e3e5.html" title="User talk:Tangotango">talk</a>) 14:45, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
