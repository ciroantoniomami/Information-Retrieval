<p>Hi Angela, why can't you get on to the main Wiki site? If it's a technological issue you should probably ask one of the developers about it. Or alternatively I can ask for you.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you've been enjoying yourself, Andrew (Ams80)</p>
<hr />
<p>It just keeps timing out - I can't get in at all. It's the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org/</a> version I was trying to use. Angela.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hello again, it might be a bit of a silly question but have you tried recently, like today? A new server was installed a little while ago before which Wikipedia was often slow. Since then there has been a lot less grumbling in general from people so I assume that things are better. I'm currently blessed with a very fast University internet connection so I don't experience access problems unless things are <i>really</i> slow. If things don't speed up for you then I'll ask on the main site if there is any reason for it. Andrew</dd>
<dd>Yes it was alright from yesterday. I did note the problem at <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:New_server_madness" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:New_server_madness" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:New_server_madness</a>.

<p>Hi Angela. Nice to see a little activity here&#160;:) I dont know what can be done for this project. Some one recently asked for a separate simplified Chinese site separate from the Traditional one -- and the thought occured to me that merging all "simple" wikis might be useful. I dunno. Thanks for your vote on RFA, BTW.&#160;:) - <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">User:Stevertigo</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Ill ask Brion then to update the software (like he isnt busy enough&#160;;) -- maybe version3 is a bit much for here -- if version2 has enough of the necessary code -- updated links, etc. Maybe it would be better to use a less fancy wiki. I dont know why though, maybe just so that we dont get too attached to speaking simply. Get back to me -- and Ill ask brion a question or two. -S-</p>
<p>Ok on the software--as for the purpose of... siphoning is a double edged sword -- if its automatic its too careless, if its by hand, then its too slow. Were trying to figure out ways to let languages talk to each other via language links that do a little of both -- the first part is to set up better ways to link langas -- like add a link/get a reverse link (2for1) and why not do this for each tag you add (since a 1:1 ratio for each is established) and going further why not search these other pages for links you might not have and add them to the original page? All easier said than done -- people are most concerned with using something either too powerful or too clumsy. So links are important. As far as what to use Simple for -- if we can do "automated concordancing" -- i dunno. I was just thinking about this problem for the arabic translation of the "wiki press release" 'Wikipedia" can be phonetically transcribed=WA,EIN,KAF,EIN, etc. (probably wrong&#160;;) but... the "press release" sounds like javascript for a mouse button function. Just to be safe, it might be better rephrased as "news media notification" etc...</p>
<p>So there are several issues -- purpose of simple.wiki/ interwiki connections/machine translation&amp;implementations of/concordancing/simplification. Whew. Are you on the intnwiki-l mailing list BTW?&#160;:)-<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 11:02, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>-- Yeah, I see your point. Simple was still born, and the notion of making a Basic English wiki seemed to be going nowhere. What would the point be? Would it be worth anyones effort? I had to imagine that there was another reason for it to exist, and this question happened to coincide with my other notion (same brain after all&#160;;) -- my other notion -- that interlingual translations could be assisted if there was a sandbox of sorts for all kinds of languages. Im working on some technical (quasi) solutions for the link problem with at least two of the developers seem interested in it. Sometimes artists can be of use!&#160;:)-S-</p>

<p>My name is Joshua. I can be found at the English WP under the name of <i>Hoshie</i>.</p>
<p>I am writing in interest to help out with this wiki. I know how hard english can be. Before I decide to help, I have two questions:</p>
<p>1) Almost all fields have jargon. How does Simple English handle this?</p>
<p>2) Is Simple English the same as Basic English?</p>
<p>Joshua (hoshie)</p>
<p>I answered on your talk page if I remember rightly. However, here is also answer from someone else; Angela</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. See <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jargon.html" title="Jargon">jargon</a> and the strategy outlined at Psychoneuroimmunology/Talk. The article on <a href="../../../h/e/a/Healing.html" title="Healing">healing</a> is a good example of how to avoid jargon and know when to refer the reader off to other articles in full English, or their own language (which is increasingly an option).</dd>
<dd>2. No. See <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_f1f8.html" title="Simple English">Simple English</a>. Anon</dd>

<p>Copied from the EN Wiki talk page:</p>
<p><i>Angela,</i></p>
<p><i>Thanks for the welcome you gave me @ the simple wiki. If you need help, feel free to contact me using the contacts on my EN user page.</i></p>

<p>---</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">Money</a> - "Anyone who tells you otherwise is just <a href="../../../l/y/i/Lying.html" title="Lying">lying</a>."</p>
<p>Same reasoning for including that as for including the rough language military jargon in <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jargon.html" title="Jargon">jargon</a>. Very often, the poor in the South are encountering strange or confusing language from people from the North, and assuming that their power comes from some magic or understanding or capacity to trust that violates normal understandings that the poor South people don't seem to "get"... this makes them quite vulnerable to being conned, gulled, defrauded, etc., at least, on matters they just don't know very well.</p>
<p>It's a fair bet that anyone who might be reading a Simple English Wikipedia entry on <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">Money</a> might well be someone faced with a situation where they are deciding whether to put their own money into some instrument which is "as good as money" or "sure to be worth money" etc., and subjected to sly reasoning confusing the various functions of money to make that appear true. The article should help people in that situation, and should say in no uncertain terms that there is <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risk.html" title="Risk">risk</a> in using any <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financial_capital.html" title="Financial capital">financial capital</a> or financial instrument that is not, in itself, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">money</a>. It should also say that anyone who says you can "make money" in a purely financial transaction without taking a <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risk.html" title="Risk">risk</a> is, put plainly, <a href="../../../l/y/i/Lying.html" title="Lying">lying</a>.</p>
<p>I think anything less plain than that can be twisted. It is true by definition that a risk of not getting money back is the whole and only difference between money and almost-money <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financial_capital.html" title="Financial capital">financial capital</a>. So it's one of the few times you can say, flatly, "non-money that becomes money without risk is a lie".</p>
<p>To clarify this kind of thing, we might outline a page on <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Users_8a5b.html" title="Simple English Users">Simple English Users</a> and try to characterize their needs, their demographics, their vulnerabilities, and their <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_limits.html" title="Time limits">time limits</a> (for instance, how much time they might have to absorb something - one reason for a one-page-per-article limit).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't like the idea of making any assumptions about the readers of this site. A</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Me neither. Thus the choice is between following our implicit assumptions and judgement, which is fine for vocabulary but maybe not so fine for choosing which topics to write about, and making out assumptions explicit to help share and neutralize them. It doesn't make any assumption to simply write a list of different situations or constraints that users might be under, as <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Users_8a5b.html" title="Simple English Users">Simple English Users</a> now does. We might even attach some demographic numbers to them, and later test those predictions against actual use with surveys. One thing we should NOT do is just assume that we're all so brilliant as to effortlessly combine our assumptions simply by writing and editing... but there is wiggle room on this, for sure. No need to do it now. But it may help those choosing a topic to write on, and realizing that we actually care about poor or disadvantaged people, might actually bring in the right people to do the writing, given this is a <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-profit.html" title="Non-profit">non-profit</a> effort.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, it probably is a good idea to make the assumptions explicit. A</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The lying bit didn't seem very encyclopedic, but I see what your point was now. It's one of the occasions when reducing it to simple English actually makes it more confusing. If it had said something like "it would be fraudulent to suggest otherwise" then I probably wouldn't have objected, but perhaps the "people are lying" part is just a simple way of expressing it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When trying to educate simple people about simple deceptions, simple words are best. Really it's a question of keeping three modes of integrity separate: investigative, definitive, and authoritative. We investigate, define and decide using three different modes of reasoning, and mixing them up is just corruption. Since non-money does not become money through any risk-free process, and that is part of how money is defined, it's fair to say that attempts to misrepresent that, are outright lying, period. It's not a question of who says so, nor a question of running experiments. If it was, I wouldn't be making a "definitive" statement. &#160;;-)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough. I've put it back in the article. A</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>See <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/integrity" class="external text" title="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/integrity" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia:integrity</a> for a not-bad outline of this, and <a href="http://wikipedia.wiki/truth" class="external text" title="http://wikipedia.wiki/truth" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia:truth</a> for some implications. Unless of course liars with no integrity have hacked those up beyond re-cognition. LOL. As they inevitably will.</dd>

Hi Angela, thanks for encouraging me to edit here. I noticed that for some reason while editing my account went to my IP number? Why is this happening? It has never happened on any other Wikipedia where I have my shingle out. <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex756.html" title="Alex756">Alex756</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I replied at en:, I guessed you see a message there sooner than here. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I read it there and came here. I like the idea of Simple English. I hate jargon and am always fighting against it. I firmly believed that anything can be explained in simple language, often language is used as a means to prevent communication more than encourage it. I will try and get Simple to do the same thing again. I think it had to do with going from a new link (without any text on it) back to the HomePage. Is that possible? <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex756.html" title="Alex756">Alex756</a></dd>

<hr />
<p>Angela, you may wish to look into some rather outrageous out-of-process deletions on the EN Wikipedia. <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/bushmeat" class="external free" title="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/bushmeat" rel="nofollow">http://wikipedia.org/wiki/bushmeat</a> in particular - this is probably a sign that the project is now on its down phase, but also a sign that the Simple English may play a role in capturing those basic and essential articles on major world issues that many people come to Wikipedia to provide, and simplifying them for a non-English-native audience.</p>
<p>I am particularly revolted at attacks on several people's honest attempts to lay out the Bushmeat question - particularly as it relates to <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/ape_genocide" class="external free" title="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/ape_genocide" rel="nofollow">http://wikipedia.org/wiki/ape_genocide</a> (another out-of-process deletion) - as it involves the extermination of helpless mute beings quite unable to defend themselves, or to engage in the technological escalation which is the stock in trade of those censoring these articles. It's quite ironic that they attack these articles, really, as it is just this technological escalation (rifles vs. gorilla hands etc.) that causes the ape genocide to begin with.</p>
<p>I trust you will advocate sane courses of action with respect, at least, to articles authored by multiple parties over a long period of time, that are on issues that are generally recognized as both real and important.</p>
<p>This is far more important than who can edit on an ongoing basis, or even who is systematically attacked for doing so - a Wikipedia with no article on the bushmeat issue is the soul of racism - our nearest hominid relatives being victims of this in a very brutal and stark way - what we have, in effect, with this kind of article targetted for deletion, is apologists for cannibalism. Appalling.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know if it was the articles they were they were attacking as such, or just you. Either way, such deletions were indeed "out of process", but reversible. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, but according to Martin's theory of the "hard ban", these deletions are not only authorized for ad hominem reasons, but reversals of them are supposed to be inhibited. This policy is obviously wrong, indeed it is stupid from the point of view of a "serious encyclopedia", which Wikipedia is not. Hopefully someone will notice this and realize that you can have EITHER an encyclopedia OR a "community", but not both. Their standards for exclusion will be quite different, and a community is what results when an encyclopedia is falling apart.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If any of this takes precedence over the plight of helpless hominids, of course, it speaks to the status of those doing such deletions, in or out of process, as moral garbage. They simply do not deserve the protections accorded to "persons" and certainly not that accorded "colleagues". What happens to them, including project-killing lawsuits from Mel Gibson, etc., is just what they deserve. I sincerely hope it will be possible to recommend to Mr. Gibson or whoever ends up owning the infrastructure that this project runs on, that those who are editorially active on the Simple English Wikipedia are in fact of high integrity - and follow their own rules, which rules make sense.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<hr />
<p>Good work refactoring all that talk!</p>
<p>Could you write some basic stuff on Simple English grammar and what might go into a Simple English audit? I know it's too early to figure out the latter, but, some heuristics like trying to speak the article out loud and asking yourself "is this how I would explain this to a grade school kid?" might help. We don't have to be rigorous yet, just have a basic set of techniques to help contributors get a good feel for constrained writing, and for what grammatical constructs are difficult in English?</p>
<p>Eventually, we may even be able to /talk to each other in <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_f1f8.html" title="Simple English">Simple English</a>. Sigh. Not yet.</p>
<hr />
<p>IEPP/Talk and <a href="../../../i/e/l/IELTS_1f88.html" title="IELTS">IELTS</a> lay out some new stuff we have to cover: the tests that many/most <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Users_8a5b.html" title="Simple English Users">Simple English Users</a> have to test to take education in English.</p>
<p>Having had enough input into scoping, I'd be more pleased if someone else fleshed those out, differentiated widespread and reputable tests from commercial preparation courses, etc... the Bell and Davis versions should also be covered.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Wikipedias_Forum" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Wikipedias_Forum" rel="nofollow">United Wikipedias Forum</a> is interesting. It seems the only language they could possibly use to keep everyone talking is <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_f1f8.html" title="Simple English">Simple English</a>. If it goes anywhere, we would be well to have lots of articles here on dispute resolution, adversarial process, mediation, arbitration, peacemaking, transformative justice, consensus, consensus decision making, consensus democracy, dissent, and all that... a lot of non-English Wikipedia users will not really understand the culture of the English speakers they encounter and have issues with. Even just the idea that all English speakers do not really accept a single moral code will be odd to some.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi, Angela. I am new to the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Wikipedia_f17d.html" title="Simple English Wikipedia">Simple English Wikipedia</a>. It looks like you are one of the "important" people here, so I am writing to you.</p>
<p>I have contributed to several articles. I see a lot of problems with people using the Wikipedia as a <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soapbox.html" title="Soapbox">soapbox</a>, and with people not keeping their English simple. (The Wikipedia software says my name is RJ208153.user.veloxzone.com.br )</p>
<dl>
<dd>I fully recognise your concerns and would appreciate any suggestions on how to handle the soapbox issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would be helpful if you would click on "preferences" at the bottom of the screen and set yourself a <a href="../../../u/s/e/Username.html" title="Username">Username</a>. Then you would have a talk page that I could reply to you on. If you object to having a username (as some do) would you object to me making a talk page for you named RJ208153 or something similar?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>"I fully recognise your concerns and would appreciate any suggestions on how to handle the soapbox issue." -- LOL. Okay, I see that other people have noticed this problem. I think that the only good answer is for many people to use the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Wikipedia_f17d.html" title="Simple English Wikipedia">Simple English Wikipedia</a>, then the problems will be seen and fixed rapidly. But of course, this is a "vicious circle" problem. If people come here and see many articles that aren't <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>, they won't want to help with this Wikipedia. I think the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese.html" title="Portuguese">Portuguese</a> language Wikipedia had some bad problems with this for a while - many of the articles there were about some medical ideas that many people thought weren't really true.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps we need to encourage people already afmiliar with Wikipedia over help. That way they won't be put off because they already know what Wikipedia is about and they will be experienced with dealing with NPOV issues. If you know of anyone suitable perhaps you could suggest this to them. A</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks Angela, I don't want to make a <a href="../../../u/s/e/Username.html" title="Username">Username</a>. I've worked on other Wikipedias and I see that some Wikipedians fight a lot. I think that Usernames help to make some people think that winning arguments with their "enemies" is more important than writing good articles. If you want to make a page for me like you said, we can try that and see if it works. If it creates a lot of fighting I'll stop using it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fair point but a username does have advantages in communication and some sort of signature on a talk page makes it easier to follow. I am likely to add signatures when things start getting complicated as I do for "142" but the people I do this for are welcome to remove them if they strongly object. A</dd>
</dl>
<p>Angela, I have two questions. 1) Are you really the "boss" of the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Wikipedia_f17d.html" title="Simple English Wikipedia">Simple English Wikipedia</a>?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Lol. Of course not. It is a collaborative project where everyone should be treated on equal terms. There ought be no hierarchy whereby some users are viewed as having more status than any other contributor. Whether or not people ascribe such status to others is another matter and one that is probably inevitable. A</dd>
</dl>
<p>2) Who makes and fixes the <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software.html" title="Software">software</a> for this Wikipedia?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The same developers that work on the English Wikipedia. A</dd>
</dl>
<p>If I have questions about this who should I ask? I didn't see any information about this on this Wikipedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You can ask here at <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_Talk_22ed.html" title="Simple Talk">Simple Talk</a>. What often happens on the non-English Wikipedias is people communicate on their own Wikipedia and then a representative takes those concerns or problems to the relevant place (directly to the developers, or to the mailing list or to Sourceforge. You can of course go directly through those channels if you prefer:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-l" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-l" rel="nofollow">Tech list</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators" rel="nofollow">List of developers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wikipedia/" class="external text" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wikipedia/" rel="nofollow">Sourceforge</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am happy to act as a go-between if people would rather discuss issues here than on the lists or elsewhere. If there is any sort of emergency technical problem, like you can't access Wikipedia at all or a vandal-bot is running then it is probably best to contact me directly if you do not have contact with the developers as I have access to their e-mail addresses and phone numbers for use in such situations. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Angela, I'm beginning to have a lot of trouble with hlfx28-197.ns.sympatico.ca . I think this person wants to make the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Wikipedia_f17d.html" title="Simple English Wikipedia">Simple English Wikipedia</a> complicated and very hard for <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Users_8a5b.html" title="Simple English Users">Simple English Users</a> to use. I think that if I stay here I will spend a lot of time fighting with this person and being angry about this. I've already had these problems before in other Wikipedias and I don't want to have them again. If this is going to be a problem for me I won't stay here. Thank you for all your help. Please don't make a page for me yet, because I don't want anything extra helping me to argue. RJ</p>
<dl>
<dd>RJ208153, please don't leave. You've been here a very short while and already done a lot of good work. If 142 is stressing you out, focus on some different topics. Wikipedia doesn't have to be perfect <i>today</i>. Maybe in ten years time it will move towards that but at this exact minute, it doesn't <i>matter</i> if an article is no more than a reflection of one contributor's opinion. There aren't many people here yet to try and help improve articles and get rid of POV and inaccuracies but the numbers will increase over time, as will the quality of the articles. You are obviously capable of writing in Simple English and for that reason this Wikipedia really needs your contributions. Please do not let a clash with one contributor put you off and certainly don't let him get you angry. Perhaps it would be best if you just made a list of the problematic pages (not necessarily online) and come back to them at some later stage. There are over 400 pages here now, so even if you only want to edit existing ones rather than writing new onesyou can find some where you are not facing contentious topics. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, please stay. I think there are two problems. 1. is that you have not really understood how different are the needs of all the different types of <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Users_8a5b.html" title="Simple English Users">Simple English Users</a>, and perhaps you do not agree that the most complex issues and most complex language must be tested, first, which is what I have been doing. We can avoid conflict if you work on the articles that must be in Simplest English, like starting points, and those that explain the Wikipedia user interface. And introduction articles on non-scientific and non-politics topics - like the ones you have done on topics in <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>. 2. the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Wikipedia_f17d.html" title="Simple English Wikipedia">Simple English Wikipedia</a> is very different from other full language wikipedias, and there are different problems that need policies to sort them out that are different from the ones that seem to work elsewhere.

Angel, this is just stupid. All these people just adding their names in the list, "yes, I support blocking people, but only with serious rules". And then they sign, and they go away. And they just make it possible for a technical solution to exist, requesting that rules are available, but making no effort whatsoever to create these rules. It feels like a knife under the neck&#160;: we have this feature there available. It is a great feature, you like it, you take it, and then manage yourself to get something decent with it. They are just sheeps. Just signing "yes, we want it, but someone please make some rules, so we can use it safely". And even if no one set the rules, the feature will be there anyway because they all like sheeps voted for it. Then, even if I disagree with it, I must try to set the rules for it, with the very little comments some leave here and there. Otherwise, we will just have a feature that everyone can use just in full anarchy. I am plain disgusted. It is a good feature for real vandals, but I know at next appearance of Papotages for example, he will be blocked with no process. Here, I know, I will write an article on <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheep.html" title="Sheep">sheep</a>...</p>
<p>Yeah. precisely. Precisely what I mean. So, we are gonna accept banning, with everyone saying we accept banning *only* with *very serious* rules, and then we will receive it with no rules whatsoever. And likely, if I set rules (since no one does), I will be told I am the only one to agree with these, and nobody else does, and how dare I...</p>

<p>Hi, Angela. I want to make a User page and User account. But I don't understand how this works on SEWiki. Is there a Log In page? I don't see one. Can we sign in and use our <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_Name_0325.html" title="User Name">User Name</a> from different computers? Does the "sign with three tildes" convention work on SEWiki?

<p>Angela, is there somewhere a page where are listed ways to do things in phase I. I forgot a bit myself, and we have someone willing to start a minor language alone, who is quite struggling.

<p>Angela, making unsubstantiated complaints over at EN: about things going on here is dishonest. If there are "bizarre viewpoints" or unjustified policy meausures (all of which are marked as draft or experimental at least at the top level) they must be debated by people actually interested in SIMPLE:, not by clowns who wilfully break the GFDL and "kidnap" articles, etc...</p>
<p>Grow up. This project has special needs EN: doesn't have, and just because a view is unfamiliar to you, doesn't make it "bizarre". Spend some time around people with these beliefs, you will eventually start to see the <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:EPOV" class="external text" title="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:EPOV" rel="nofollow">English Point Of View</a> as bizarre.</p>
<p>If you have a complaint about what's going on here, keep it here.</p>
<p>Calling for this kind of sabotage over here is particularly irresponsible:</p>

<p>I know this is probably humourous and you might laugh at me, but it's something I want fixed. Whenever I attempt to look up something at the English Wikipedia, I get another site instead. This doesn't happen anywhere else online, but it's been happening for months to the point where I believe somebody sabotaged my IP address from being able to visit there. I know there are a few users at the English Wikipedia who detest me, but that is just going too far and I demand something to be done about it. I am not contributing anything and haven't even thought of doing so for the longest time now. Please find out what the hell is going on. I don't like how it appears to be a fellow Wikipedia user that has found some way to disrupt my connection to that website. These are the sites that I am pissed off at seeing any time I look up a topic on Google and click on the English Wikipedia. Blocking them hasn't enabled me to see Wikipedia, just prevented me from seeing these sites:</p>

<dd>I don't think it is possible anyone at Wikipedia has caused this. Perhaps you have a virus. Have you tried using a different browser?

<p>Angela, I am upset because it is only the English Wikipedia and quite a few people detested me there and wanted to ban me for good but it wasn't happening. I only have one browser and yes, I checked that it's a Wikipedia site that morphs into another. The other languages work, the Wiktionary works, etc., but not the one that several people were mad about me being at. I will try to weed out a virus now. - Kenneth Alan</p>
<p>Ah, yes, now it is fixed. I grew brave enough to use a spyware killer. I just hope it doesn't bite me in the arse in the future. Thanks for your time Angela. - Kenneth Alan</p>
<p>Too bad, I have experienced the bullshit again. Despite having a spy/ad/malware killer, it doesn't want to permanently go away. - Kenneth Alan</p>
<p>I think I understand. Mats Haldin from the Swedish Wikipedia has been doing this to me. He calls me "Troll" all the time. He hates me soooo much and when I asked for help on the Swedish Wikipedia, he helped affect a blocking of me despite nice responses from others when I wanted to fix the sabotage. I fixed it with another removal program and I hope it goes away for good. - Kenneth Alan</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is not possible for a user on Wikipedia to force you to go to different sites. If you are still being redirected to pages like pillsexpert, this must be a problem with your computer, not with anyone blocking you. Being blocked from Wikipedia just gives you a message like the one at <a href="../../../b/l/o/MediaWiki%7EBlockedtext_22db.html" title="MediaWiki:Blockedtext">MediaWiki:Blockedtext</a>. Have you tried accessing it with a different browser? Try using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" class="external text" title="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" rel="nofollow">Firefox</a> instead and see if that helps. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 00:39, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not that it's a problem to edit, the problem lies in being able to get past a redirect. I'm trying to install Firefox right now. You still don't think there's something wrong with the English site? That is the ONLY site I ever go to that redirects to my misfortune. Thanks btw. - Kenneth Alan</p>

Are you sure you are typing in the correct URL? Perhaps you are going to something similar. Do links like <a href="../../../../en/index.html" class="extiw" title="en:">this</a> take you to the right place?

<p>I complained because I believe I have been victimised by a handful of vengeful Wikipedians or at least just one. Since I got a second spyware remover and second browser, the problem has stopped. Although at this time that could be also because those I have alleged openly as attributable to my problem probably took quick notice to stop before they get caught. I haven't tried your version of links before, just the basic, general http address in the address bar or clicking onto links from google or wikipedia clones to try and access the main website.
