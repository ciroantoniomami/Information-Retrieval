<p>I did read your pseudo at different places here. You seem to be a kind of VIP. Can you help me in following matter:</p>
<p>"Hi</p>
<p>I did work this evening 2 hours in this part of wikipedia and after that my pages did disappair after an imperative request of a troll with the pseudo netoholic, the author of the totaly useless and for this reason nonsens list of 850 words of basic english, a list being extremly easy to find in english (in other languages, it is different! the access of the different translations = significations of the 850 english basic english word is very hard to get in france and difficult enough in germany! and i suppose that it will not be better in other countries...) on the web and in diverse book too, to brake my work! For me it is not a hasard but i suppose that netoholic did erase my work.</p>
<p>In my eyes is natoholic probably an troll. On many points on his discussions page it is the question of annoyance! Natoholic seems to be a magnet for unpeace! I am really unplaised that he didn't give me the possibility to save my long work. Find you really that it is a good and fair kind of social intercourse on a web enterprise where fairnis has to be an principal matter of success? In presence of such a despise a lot of people can be tempted to act against wikipedia. vandalism is a matter who interess Natoholic, i see on his page! of course: Natoholic give the other no chance to choice a different way: Natoholic will an causes war on wikipedia! and after that are the other the bad boys...</p>
<p>Is wikipedia a entreprise of "little kings" or "little gods"?"</p>

<p>Hi Angela! "Please don't call people trolls without reason". But if I have reasons? What is the competence of Netoholic to decide if a page is a matter for this site or not? If Netoholic starts a war with a new comer who don't uses bad words or write tendencious topics, he is a troll and causes the begin of a destructive process... I have good reason why I did place my informations on this site and I find it is a good reason of the existence for this site. Only to make the same as on the main English Wikipedia site, would be a separate site for simple English nonsens. "Simple English" is also a nonsens. It is infatuate pidjin English or poor full English? Can you define Simple English? The only one rational approach for that is to reserve such site for a real standard type of limited English and 2 standards exist really: Basic English and VAO English! It is the flagrant evidence of lack of competence.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Angela! I did find my pages again (through the "history"; probably I am now expert in using of history on wikipedia pages...). The troll WAS Netoholic: we can see it in the history. Your site is a real factory for trolls. I am sorry for you! I can understand that this work is important for you. I did see your old pages from Mai 2003 etc. I did see the old pages of Netoholic. But it is not a reason to handle in such a maniere against persons who are working in a different way as you. You have your opinion. And other people have also her opinion... If you want only see your opinion or if Netoholic want to see only his opinion, it would be better for you to publish only on a closed site like the basic english site etc... in an other case, you get war because your own comportment is unfreedly! I did see, that you have a big activity concerning "vandalism", "trolls" etc. but your own comportment (you, all the old "owner" of this site) is probably the most important reason of this reaction of other people. I will post this message on the discussion page of Netoholic and go away. You are poor people, and deform Basic English in such way that Basic English can't be any a serious alternative for other people. Your enterprise is really a very bad enterprise...</dd>

<p>Just to let you know, Angela, i am not reporting vandalism from sock puppets, but it kinda has to do with it. Gracker wants to leave the site, but he dosen't want his name to just be used as a "toy" for other people to use it. Gracker is granting me permission to use his user name. now hear me out, i will follow three simple rules:</p>
<pre>
                    1.i will not vandalize
                    2.i will not use Jonesc as long as i am Gracker
                    3.i will write articles that actually have a meaning to them(unlike amphibian visual cortex)
</pre>
<p>I only ask one more thing from you, clear Gracker's file so people still won't think i am a vandalist, that is, if you let me become Gracker.You cxan block me and Gracker if you let me be Gracker and i use Jonesc-Jonesc</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can't clear people's contributions lists if that's what you mean. Perhaps it would be best to get a new user name and start afresh? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 19:38, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Angela, I'm going to ask if you can help me with Netoholic's behavior.

You can see on his <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">talk page</a> that this is not an isolated incident and that he's already driven away <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcoVD_616c.html" title="User:MarcoVD">User:MarcoVD</a>.

<p><br />
Simple is in a bad predicament. First of all, we have throngs of editors who are largely refugees from EN: - either because they feel lost in the mix there, or have a particular POV approach which meets resistance there. They re-create articles and WP processes here without considering this project as anything but Yet Another english Wikipedia. Thorpe, who created that screenshot, is one of these types.</p>
<p>This wiki can be one of the best if we concentrate on providing and maintaining a strictly-defined "core" of article subjects which can be translated or <i>perhaps</i> some day printed. en: Wikipedia 1.0 will never be a reality. Simple could achieve it with some stronger self-regulation. If that means some editors leave, then they have their native language wiki to go to. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 21:02, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you very much for your comment. Your input is valuable. I do not know if you looked at the page I referred to above or not, but it seems as if you might not have, so perhaps you will allow me to give you a short explanation of my personal reasons for thinking it should exist.</dd>

<dd>Basically, it should exist for the same reason that Simple English Wikipedia itself should exist: to be a simplified resource for people who do not know English well. When a person who for whatever reason does not know English well (our target audience) comes on Simple English Wikipedia, they often need definitions of many words. English Wiktionary uses definitions that are often (but not always) too complicated and require looking up other words to understand the definition. Simple English Wiktionary uses simpler definitions so that people with less English knowledge can understand them. This exactly corresponds to Simple English Wikipedia's simpler articles on encyclopedic topics. Definitions should not be here either, because this is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary, and for the same reasons that definitions are on English Wiktionary, not English Wikipedia. Thus, Simple English Wiktionary fills a gap and is a valuable resource, IMO. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromwellt_01fc.html" title="User:Cromwellt">Cromwellt</a>|<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECromwellt_00dc.html" title="User talk:Cromwellt">talk</a> 16:26, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear <b>Angela</b>, thank you for supporting my Request for Adminship. And double thanks for putting me back on the track. I hope it will pass (in 3 days time, it will).

<p>Hi Angela. Could you please add <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_7cf9.html" title="Bahá'í Faith">Bahá'í Faith</a> to the religion/belief section. The page is now at a level of content that exceeds some of the beliefs listed there. If changes to it need to be made before hand, such as simplification of language, please let me know. I tried to keep it to BE1500, but I'm new at this. - <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristianEdwardGruber_f5cf.html" title="User:ChristianEdwardGruber">Christian Edward Gruber</a> 20:22, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You seem to be an admin... I'd like to complain about <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">User:Netoholic</a> about his irrational behaviour concerning a spelling dispute.
