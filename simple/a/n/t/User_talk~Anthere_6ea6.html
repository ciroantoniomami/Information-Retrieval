As someone who is not a native English speaker your input is very important. Thanks.</p>

<p>Agriculture/talk suggests some things to try. Also if you can help with <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Users_8a5b.html" title="Simple English Users">Simple English Users</a> that would be useful too.</p>
<p>A Simple English Reading in Agriculture would also be valuable.</p>

<p>Hi Anthère. It's nice to see your name in recent changes again. I'm glad you haven't given up on Wikipedia altogether.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, absolutely. Anthere, please read SEUS_Juan_Looks_At_The_Sky. If you can write a couple of these, we could start to get some better ideas about how to serve <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Users_8a5b.html" title="Simple English Users">Simple English Users</a>. - trolls</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>It reminds me of Votes for deletion at en. They all say "oh it must be kept", "it can be improved", "you can do this with it", "merge it somewhere else" but none of them ever do this. They just want to vote - they don't want to help improve those articles. They think they can just sit in VfD and tell someone else to do the work. All some people do is sit in VfD or sit in the mailing lists complaining. They never even write articles or help to improve existing ones. They want to have a say on everything without putting in any effort. And if someone gets wrongy blocked they will all blame you for not making the rules clear enough! <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>If you make the rules they will blame you for the rules being no good and say that no-one agrees with them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you don't make the rules they will blame for being too lazy to bother making any rules.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You can't win! People like that will complain no matter what you do.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>

<dd>And the worse is that I know I will lose because whether I do it or not, I will lose nevertheless&#160;:-(</dd>

<dd>"I don't even know for sure on which article we are in a major edit war" - lol - I get the same thing. People get angry at me and I didn't even notice there was an edit war and I didn't think I was in one! Some people see things in a very funny way. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>LOL. I went over the history of the past pages we shared, and I think it is over <a href="../../../../fr/%C3%A9/c/o/%C3%A9cologiste_4e8c.html" class="extiw" title="fr:écologiste">fr:écologiste</a>, though I am not sure. Look at the history <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=%C9cologiste&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=%C9cologiste&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=%C9cologiste&amp;action=history</a></p>
<p>does that look like an edit war&#160;?</p>
<p>look at the discussion page <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discuter%3A%C9cologiste" class="external free" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discuter%3A%C9cologiste" rel="nofollow">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discuter%3A%C9cologiste</a></p>
<p>does that look like an edit war&#160;?</p>
<p>I mentionned in the talk page that his current paragraph was perhaps a bit err... strong... and required eventually a citation or an example</p>
<p>He wrote</p>
<p>The ethic of <i>ecologists</i> is often assailed (or onslaughted&#160;?) by their detractors who see only hystery there. Among the most virulent are the industrials, the civil actors of nuclear energy appear, the military, farmers practicing intensive and even integrated agriculture as well, chemical industry increasingly oriented toward <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetic_engineering.html" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a>, seed industry, and hunters.</p>
<p>I merely said that "onslaughted" (he used a very very very hard term) was perhaps not very npov, that an example would be fine (not that it should be hard to found), that citing those doing integrated agriculture was perhaps going a bit far, that chemical industry had little to do directly with genetic engineering, and that perhaps citing such a long list was curious if those listed were said the *most* virulent. So, I just suggested rephrasing, examples and citations.</p>
<p>So, he removed his paragraph (one of mine in the process, which I put back) and is now claiming we are in major war, that he is very upset because the topic is very important to him and that of course no one could have missed our major disagreement. Oie, if it is so important to him he can't bear a tiny criticism, he better quit. What would he say if I were treating him like RK is treating the ones he disagrees with&#160;:-)))) I don't think either anyone noticed a pb, and that anyone has the slightest beginning of the idea where the conflict is&#160;:-)</p>
<p>I fail to see what to do really&#160;:-(</p>
<p>You know, Wikipedia is really a weird place&#160;:-) We are major paranoid people&#160;:-)</p>
<p>thanks for the improvment to sheep. That was perfect.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That does not look like an edit war at all. You were only adding information, not taking anything away. He is complaining about nothing IMO.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I just read the discussion of interlanguage links at fr and how Traroth wants the links on separate lines. This hasn't really been discussed at en but Kricxjo told him not to do this (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%20talk:Traroth" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%20talk:Traroth" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%20talk:Traroth</a>). Will you tell me if anything is decided about it please? Also, have you seen <a href="http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_language_skills" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_language_skills" rel="nofollow">poor language skills</a> at Meta. You might want to say something there. Does what I wrote on my <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:Angela" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:Angela" rel="nofollow">user page</a> at fr make sense? I think it should be "ma page de discussion" not "ma page de discuter". Is anything else wrong? I would really appreciate if you could tell me or fix it for me&#160;:). Thank you. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></dd>

<dd>there was an extended discussion on fr about placement of links, and spaces between each item. Generally speaking, Traroth was outvoted. He commited the mistake to shout after Orthogaffe, our bot, because this one "reverted" Traroth position work&#160;:-) I do not think any thing was really changed in the end. He was told he could do the way he wanted, but not complain that others did differently&#160;:-)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I showered my problematic one with compliment and offered him new food for thought. Non controversial&#160;:-) He seemed more quiet today. I talked to another about him by email, asking opinion, but this latter chose not to answer on this point. Hum...I'll see how it develops. I am walking on eggs.</dd>

<hr />
<p>Hi, Anthere. I have a question for you. It seems to me that you are an <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_As_A_Second_Language_8961.html" title="English As A Second Language">English As A Second Language</a> (or third or fourth&#160;:-) ) user, but not really a <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_f1f8.html" title="Simple English">Simple English</a> user. I.e., your English is pretty good. What do you think about this? -- RJ092191.user.veloxzone.com.br</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>ESL&#160;: English As A Second Language. Okay, right. Does this place has a Jargon&#160;? If not, it should.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do not think I am a simple english user. I understand most regular english articles. I do not understand them well when they are specialised in topics I know little about, and only secondary when they use too much jargon. I can guess jargon in topics I know. There are some topics I now feel more confortable with in english, because I know the english jargon, but not the french&#160;:-)))</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So I would not be a user of this place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, reading, understanding and writing are three different things. I can write poor english rather quickly. Not so quickly to provide better english. On en: I mostly create new articles on specialised topics, when I see noone else is doing so - a bad article is better than none. I sometimes add to already developped topics, but not often as I fear being said I spoil an article. I extremely rarely refactor other people writing. Some say ESL people should not write simple as it requires very good english to be able to write in simple english. I think I could write in simple english, but am having problems to write simple content. So, I am a full-english user, I am not a simple english user, I am a semi-editor on simple and full english, and generally speaking a full pain&#160;:-)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I could be a german simple user&#160;:-)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>do you speak other languages&#160;?</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>I don't know of any list. I think new languages could now start straight into phase III. There isn't a reason to use this old software anymore.</p>
<dl>
<dd>was asked...but not done&#160;:-(</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think you can do things like check for "lonely pages".</p>
<dl>
<dd>don't remember this feature either</dd>
</dl>
<p>Theer aren't really any special features like that here. You can't list the users or whatever.</p>
<dl>
<dd>of course since we are pages. I don't even remember the command for all pages&#160;:-(</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="http://simple.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?action=index" class="external text" title="http://simple.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?action=index" rel="nofollow">All pages</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can see what to a page by clicking the title though. I think that is the only special feature.</p>
<p>You are right about images - they are just links.</p>
<p>You can't really have admins like you can on phase II or III. I think you need to get a password from Jimbo which then lets you delete and move pages.</p>
<dl>
<dd>tse tse, I was admin on fr for a good while on phase I. I could delete (permanent deletion), move pages, and block user and ip. It was a pain to do. I told the guy Jimbo would probably refuse it at first, because no one know him, and because he would be alone. Hum.</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>thanks. It is too bad the way it works was listed no where.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is but hopefully the old software will all be changed soon so it won't matter.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>btw, Looxix wrote me to ask me what was going on about the pb I talked to you about. I feel less stupid seeing that others noticed the problem, and do not understand better&#160;:-(</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Good. I'm glad you're not alone in it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela.html" title="Angela">Angela</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Whaoouu, all transfered and cleaned up. Nice&#160;:-) ant</p>
