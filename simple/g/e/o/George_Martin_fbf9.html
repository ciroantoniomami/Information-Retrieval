	    <p><b>Sir George Martin</b> (born <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">January 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>) is a (now-retired) British <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_producer.html" title="Record producer">record producer</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Composer.html" title="Composer">composer</a> and musical arranger, whose most famous work was his recordings with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, made at <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbey_Road_Studios_bcc9.html" title="Abbey Road Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a> during the 1960s.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Martin_fbf9.html" title="Edit section: Early Life and Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early Life and Career</span></h2>
<p>Martin grew up playing <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> with only a few music lessons, but began to compose music in his teens. He played with his own band called the Four Tune-Tellers, and he dreamed of one day making soundtrack music for movies.</p>
<p>After serving in the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Martin went to music school, making up for the formal training he missed earlier. After he graduated, he worked for the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, then joined the staff of EMI in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>. He became an assistant at Parlophone Records, a small <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_label.html" title="Record label">record label</a>, which featured mostly <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_music.html" title="Classical music">classical music</a> and original cast recordings of popular stage shows and plays.</p>
<p>Martin later became the chief of Parlophone Records, and also its staff producer, in charge of recording sessions and choosing songs for Parlophone artists to record. He made <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy.html" title="Comedy">comedy</a> records (often working with Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan) along with his usual jobs, to help promote the label. When <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_roll.html" title="Rock and roll">rock and roll</a> became popular in the mid-1950s, Martin began looking for rock groups or artists to join Parlophone. He recorded several such artists, but none of their records became big hits.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Martin_fbf9.html" title="Edit section: The Beatles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Beatles</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, Beatles manager <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Epstein_c309.html" title="Brian Epstein">Brian Epstein</a> brought Martin a demo (demonstration record) of his band, after trying for months to get the band a recording contract. Martin liked what he heard, saw that the young band were willing to try different things, and gave them an audition (a studio tryout). All the Beatles passed their audition, except for their drummer, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Best_e979.html" title="Pete Best">Pete Best</a>. Martin was not happy with the skills Best showed, and wanted to replace him on their recordings. When the band found out, they fired Best, replacing him with <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringo_Starr_ef1f.html" title="Ringo Starr">Ringo Starr</a>, who played with them before when Best was not available. Martin used a studio drummer on their first single, "Love Me Do", because there was no time to audition Starr before the record had to be made, but he never did so again.</p>
<p>With Starr as their drummer, and Martin as their producer (who sometimes joined them in playing, to give the records a bigger sound), the Beatles became the most popular act in the history of show business. While Beatles <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> wrote most of the band's songs, they were musically untrained, as Martin had been earlier. Martin helped develop their musical ideas, helped the band learn to talk to other musicians about the sounds they wanted to make, and added a classical touch to many of their songs. His work with them in turn made Martin famous, and he was able to leave EMI to become a "producer for hire". He started his own company, called Associated Independent Recording (AIR), with some other producers.</p>
<p>When the Beatles began to break up in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, Martin felt the tension between the band's members, and was sometimes criticized for not being able to "fix things", or solve their problems. He began turning down sessions with the band, and let the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recording_engineer.html" title="Recording engineer">recording engineer</a> or the members themselves do his job. Martin returned to help make their last album (titled <i>Abbey Road</i> after the location of the studio), after all the Beatles promised to work with him "like the old days", and let Martin take charge of the sessions once more.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Martin_fbf9.html" title="Edit section: After The Beatles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">After The Beatles</span></h2>
<p>Paul McCartney, the most "conventional" (normal) Beatle, worked with Martin several times after the Beatles ended in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>. John Lennon counted on Martin to turn his sometimes "way-out" ideas into finished records, but he didn't always like the way Martin worked, and mostly produced his own solo recordings. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Harrison_e25f.html" title="George Harrison">George Harrison</a>, the youngest Beatle, found many of his songs and ideas rejected by Martin, who later admitted "I was always rather beastly to George," in the drive to make more hit records. Harrison also produced (or co-produced) most of his own solo work, even building his own recording studio after years of making records at Abbey Road. Martin praised Ringo Starr's "super-steady beat", and the sound his drums gave the Beatles records, but each later worked with other people.</p>
<p>Even years after they broke up, Martin still worked with and for the Beatles and the music they'd made together. He <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remix.html" title="Remix">remixed</a> many of their recordings for re-issues and compilation records, made several records of his own with classical and <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orchestra.html" title="Orchestra">orchestral</a> versions of Beatles tunes, and was the music producer for <i>Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>, a <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy.html" title="Fantasy">fantasy</a> movie based on their songs, which starred the <a href="../../../b/e/e/Bee_Gees_%28The%29_693d.html" title="Bee Gees (The)">Bee Gees</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Frampton_c4fb.html" title="Peter Frampton">Peter Frampton</a>.</p>
<p>Besides the Beatles, Martin worked with other recording artists, including <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirley_Bassey_53eb.html" title="Shirley Bassey">Shirley Bassey</a>, Bernard Cribbins, America, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_Rogers_6961.html" title="Kenny Rogers">Kenny Rogers</a>, Dudley Moore, and Little River Band. He wrote a book, <i>All You Need is Ears</i>, that told his life story and explained how many of his most famous recordings were made. During the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, Martin was made a <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">knight</a> by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">British</a> government, for his work and his role in popular music.</p>
<p>Martin retired in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, and released an album titled <i>In My Life</i>, which featured many different artists performing Beatles tunes, including non-musicians like comedian Jim Carrey.</p>
