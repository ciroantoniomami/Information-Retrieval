Descendants of Jacobus were Roosevelt family of Hyde Park, New York. Eleanor was a descendant of the Johannes branch. Her future husband, Franklin was descended from the Jacobus branch.</p>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt, one of the Presidents of the United States, was her uncle. He was like a father to Eleanor, the future First Lady. Anna Eleanor liked to use the name Eleanor, using her name as Anna Eleanor only in official papers and for signing bank checks.

<p>Her parents died early. After this, her maternal grandmother, Marry Ludlow Hall (1843-1919) raised her. She spent her childhood in Tivoli, New York. Most of her mother’s family members look down at her, perhaps because she was having plain looks and a six-foot tall frame. Even her Hyde Park Roosevelts, including her future mother-in-law, Sara Delano Roosevelt, would remark to her about the Manhattan Roosevelts: "we got all the looks and the money."</p>
<p>In recent times, allegations have surfaced that in her maternal grandmother’s home, she felt insecure. Many male members used to consume a lot of drinks. Once when she was visiting her aunt Bamie Roosevelt (sister of her future husband, Theodore Roosevelt), she broke down and in tears exclaimed, "I have no real home."</p>
<p>Aunt Bamie was very helpful. She tried to find better educational opportunities for her. She arranged that Eleanor go to England for education, and Eleanor readily agreed.</p>

<p>Eleanor received encouragement from Bamie Roosevelt, sister of Theodore Roosevelt, to get a good education. She went to London, and started her studies in a girls’ boarding school at Allenswood, outside London. She studied there from 1899 to 1902. Mademoiselle Marie Souvestre was her headmistress. Later Eleanor would recall that Souvestre was one of the three main persons to influence her life.</p>
<p>During summers, Eleanor visited Europe along with her headmistress, Souvestre. She also studied history, language and literature. She became interested in social justice, and her studies gave her knowledge and confidence to present her views on many issues. One of her great moments at her school at Allenswood was when she made the field hockey team. She was one of the favorite students of the school, and when she returned to the USA, the school missed her.</p>

They started meeting each other. They got engaged in November 1903. However, FDR’s mother was against their marriage. She event sent FDR on a long tour to delay the marriage, and change FDR’s mind. However, on 17th March 1905, FDR and Eleanor married. The day was St. Patrick’s Day. President <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> took the place of his brother to give away her in marriage.</p>
<p>Even after the marriage, Eleanor’s mother-in-law, continued to advise (and perhaps interfere) in the young couple’s life.</p>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt felt bad about her children's unsuccessful private lives. Sometimes, during arguments with his adult son, she would comment that she "would be better off dead" and competing with them and overshadowing them.</p>
<p>After her husband’s death in 1945, Eleanor Roosevelt continued to live on the Hyde Park Estate, in Val-Kill. Her husband her remodeled the house near their main house. This house gave her privacy, which she had wanted for years. Her husband had remodeled this place for her. It was near their main house. Originally built as a small furniture factory for Val-Kill Industries, it afforded Eleanor a level of privacy that she had wanted for many years.

<p>She supported the American Civil Rights Movement (1896-1954) and rights of the African-American. However, her husband needed the support of Democrats of southern states of the USA. Therefore, he was not vocal about the American Civil Rights Movement. Eleanor became his connection to the African-American population instead, helping Franklin Roosevelt to win a lot of votes.</p>
<p>In 1939, the African-American <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">opera</a> singer Marian Anderson did not get permission to perform at a particular place known as the Constitution Hall in Washington. Eleanor arranged for Anderson to perform on the steps of another important place named Lincoln Memorial, to a live audience of 70,000. Millions of people listened to this on the radio.</p>

<p>During the Second War, her husband, as the President of the United States, signed an order named Executive Order 9066. This order confine in special camps about 110,000 American citizens of Japanese descent. Eleanor opposed her husband's decision to sign this order.</p>
<p>For some period, she was earning $1,000 a week for advertising for the Pan-American Coffee Bureau. Eight foreign governments used to support and fund the Bureau. The US State Department tried to cancel the deal, but could not do so.</p>

<p>After the Second World War, she along with René Cassin, John Peters Humphrey and others, drafted a declaration for the United Nations: UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. She also served as the first chairman of the U.N. Human Rights Commission. On 10th December 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted the declaration. This made her very famous, and was a great achievement for her.</p>
<p>For about four decades, beginning from 1920s until her death in 1962, Eleanor continued her association with political matters. She opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. She thought that this amendment would prevent the US Congress from passing other rules for protection of women workers.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_Roosevelt_a44d.html" title="Edit section: The Catholic issue">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Catholic issue</span></h3>
<p>In July 1949, her unsure attitude toward American Catholics caused a public debate with Francis Cardinal Spellman, the Catholic Archbishop of New York. Eleanor had written against certain proposals like funding of certain (nonreligious) activities, such as bus transportation for students, of Catholic schools. Spellman pointed out that the Supreme Court had recently upheld such provisions. He also accused her of anti-Catholicism. Most Democrats rallied behind Eleanor Roosevelt and supported her. Spellman came to Eleanor's Hyde Park home to bridge their differences.</p>
<p>In any case, Eleanor was never as popular among Catholics as her husband. They were also not happy at Eleanor’s support birth control movement. They had also resented her prewar (before the Second World War) sponsorship of the American Youth Congress, in which the Communists had been heavily represented, but Catholic youth groups were not represented.</p>

<p>In 1954, Carmine DeSapio campaigned against Eleanor's son, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., during the New York Attorney General elections. Franklin (Jr.) lost. Eleanor held DeSapio responsible for her son's defeat. She became disgusted with the political conduct of DeSapio through the rest of 1950s. She, joined with her old friends like Herbert Lehman and Thomas Finletter, succeeded in removing DeSapio from power in 1961.</p>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt was a close friend of Adlai Stevenson. She supported his candidacies in the 1952 and 1956 presidential elections. She backed Stevenson once again in 1960 but <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> received the presidential nomination.</p>

<p>Sara Delano Roosevelt was her mother-in-law. Even before Eleanor married FDR, She did not have a good relationship with Sara Delano. Biographers and historians still continue to discuss the issue and the reasons for their difficult relationship. However, in early years of her marriage, Eleanor valued suggestions from her mother-in-law until she herself could develop confidence in domestic matters.</p>
<p>Perhaps Sara wanted great success for his son, FDR, in all matters of life, including marriage. She had always given her affection to FDR to the extent of spoiling her. She even gave costly gifts to FDR and Eleanor’s children. Sometimes, Eleanor had problems, which came with such costly gifts of her mother-in-law.</p>

<p>Eleanor always enjoyed the good graces of her uncle Theodore Roosevelt, the main figure of the Oyster Bay Roosevelts. However, she found her at odds with her cousin Alice Roosevelt. Alice was a daughter of Theodore Roosevelt. Uncle Theodore felt Eleanor's conduct more responsible, socially acceptable and cooperative than her own daughter Alice. Alice was beautiful and highly photogenic, but a rebellious person. Sometimes Theodore Roosevelt would tell her: "Why cannot you be more like 'cousin Eleanor'?" These experiences laid a life-long unhappy relationship between two high profile cousins.</p>
<p>With the rise in the political career of FDR, relationship between Eleanor and Oyster Bay Roosevelts perhaps became worse. There would be comments by "cousin Alice," such as her later description of FDR as "two-thirds mush and one-third Eleanor". However, at FDR’s presidential inauguration in 1933, invitations went to Alice to attend along with her brothers Kermit Roosevelt and Archibald Roosevelt. Eleanor was close to her cousins, Kermit Roosevelt and Archibald Roosevelt</p>

<p>The marriage of Eleanor and FDR had begun with happiness. However, many people believe that FDR developed an affair with Eleanor's social secretary Lucy Mercer, later Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd. FDR once told her mother that he was thinking of divorce. His mother Sara opposed this forcefully. She warned FDR that she would disinherit him. By this time, she had become fond of Eleanor. Lucy was a Catholic, and her marriage to a Protestant FDR was also not a good idea. Finally, FDR agreed to be faithful to Eleanor. But still his contacts with Lucy Mercer perhaps continued till his death. Family members also stopped minding as FDR was suffering from many illnesses Lucy’s presence gave him some happiness and comfort.</p>

<p>The married life of Eleanor and FDR never caused much problem. But, many biographers and historians believe that Eleanor was bisexual. She became friendly with Lorena Hickok. Lorena was a correspondent of the Associated Press. She conducted many interviews of Eleanor. Many rumors arose about their lesbian relationship.</p>
<p>Her family members refuted all such claims. Her son James Roosevelt maintained that his mother "did not know what a homosexual was" and believed that his mother who grew up in the Victorian era often used tones that could seem overly affectionate leading to her statements being misconstrued. Her cousin Alice with whom she had not very happy relations also refuted any such claims. Once she stated loudly in a fashionable restaurant, "I do not care what they say. I simply cannot believe that Eleanor Roosevelt is a <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a>." Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves, a grand child of Eleanor stated in recent years that her grandmother Eleanor did indeed love Lorena Hickok but determined to remain <a href="../../../a/s/e/Asexual.html" title="Asexual">asexual</a> in the years following the affair of her husband.</p>
<p>In recent years, some evidences indicate her relationship with at least one man, her longtime bodyguard Earl Miller</p>

Eleanor in later years</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>, all volumes of her <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography.html" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a> were compiled into <i>The Autobiography of Eleanor Roosevelt</i>. However, it will be printed some 45 years later.</p>
<p>After her husband’s death, she lived for about 20 years. Eleanor Roosevelt survived her husband by nearly 20 years. From 1919, she had suffered from bone marrow <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tuberculosis.html" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. It had recurred from time to time.</p>
<p>She died on the evening of 7th November 1962 at her apartment in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, New York City. At the time of her death, she was about 78 years old. She lies buried next to her husband, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> in Hyde Park, New York. People liked her so much that a commemorative cartoon published at the time simply showed two angels looking down towards an opening in the clouds with the caption "She's here", since no introduction was needed and people could understand that “she” meant Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt kept a life long strong loyalty with Theodore Roosevelt ("Uncle Ted"). Her belongings included her membership card for the Theodore Roosevelt Association.</p>
<p>In 1968 she received the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights. After her death, there was an unsuccessful move to award her <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Peace_Prize_60fc.html" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Roosevelt was an accomplished archer, and one of the first modern women to participate in the sport of bow hunting. She even wrote using a male name “Chuck Painton” about her hunting experiences in a popular hunting magazine of that time, <i>Ye Sylvan Archer</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One of Roosevelt's prized hunting trophies had adorned her husband library. It is now a part of the Community Forum Collection of the Smithsonian Institution.</li>
