<p>Ernest Hemingway was born in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1899.html" title="1899">1899</a>. He grew up in Oak Park, <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>, near the middle western <a href="../../../c/i/t/City.html" title="City">city</a> of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a>. He was the second child in a <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family.html" title="Family">family</a> of six. His <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father.html" title="Father">father</a> was a <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor.html" title="Doctor">doctor</a>. His <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother.html" title="Mother">mother</a> liked to paint and play the <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a>.</p>
<p>Each <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer.html" title="Summer">summer</a>, the family travelled to their holiday home in northern <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>. Ernest's father taught him how to catch <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish.html" title="Fish">fish</a>, hunt, set up a <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp.html" title="Camp">camp</a>, and cook over a <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire.html" title="Fire">fire</a>.</p>
<p>At home in Oak Park, Ernest wrote for his school <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a>. He tried to write like a famous <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">sports</a> writer, Ring Lardner, and he made his writing skills better.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>, Hemingway decided not to go to a <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">university</a>. The United States had just entered <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> and he wanted to join the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">Army</a>, but it rejected him because his <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eye.html" title="Eye">eyesight</a> was not good enough.</p>
<p>Ernest found a <a href="../../../j/o/b/Job.html" title="Job">job</a> with the <i>Kansas City Star</i> <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a> in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City%2C_Missouri_d52a.html" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>.

One reporter said: "<i>Hemingway liked to be where the action was.</i>"</p>
<p>The Kansas City Star told its <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reporter.html" title="Reporter">reporters</a> to write short <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sentence.html" title="Sentence">sentences</a>, and to report unusual details of an incident. Hemingway quickly learned to do both.</p>

<p>Hemingway worked for the newspaper for nine months. He then joined the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Cross_7021.html" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> to help on the battlefields of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. His job was to drive one of its <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truck.html" title="Truck">trucks</a> and take wounded <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soldier.html" title="Soldier">soldiers</a> away from <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle.html" title="Battle">battle</a> .</p>
<p>The Red Cross sent him to <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, where he soon saw his first wounded when a <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapon.html" title="Weapon">weapons</a> <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory.html" title="Factory">factory</a> in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan.html" title="Milan">Milan</a> exploded. Later, he was sent to the battle front. He went close to the fighting to see how he would act in the face of danger. Soon, he was seriously wounded.</p>
<p>Soon after he healed, the war ended. Hemingway returned to the United States. After less than a year he had changed forever: he needed to write about what he had seen.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Hemingway_f01d.html" title="Edit section: Gone to Chicago">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gone to Chicago</span></h3>
<p>Some time later, Hemingway left home for <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a> to prove to himself, and to his family, that he could earn a living from his writing.</p>
<p>But he ran out of money and began to write for a newspaper again. The <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> newspaper, the Toronto Star, loved his reports about life in Chicago. They hired him and paid him well.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Hemingway met Sherwood Anderson, one of the first American writers to write about common people. Hemingway saw that Anderson's stories showed life as it really was, similar to what he wanted to do.</p>
<p>Anderson gave Hemingway advice about his writing. He told Hemingway to move to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, where living was less costly. He said that city had many young <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artist.html" title="Artist">artists</a> and writers from many <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">nations</a>.</p>
<p>In return for Anderson's kindness, Hemingway wrote a book called <i>The Torrents of Spring</i>. It makes fun of his friend and the way he wrote. Hemingway felt he could not say "thank you" to anyone. He had to believe he did everything for himself, even when he knew others helped him.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Hemingway_f01d.html" title="Edit section: In Paris">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In Paris</span></h3>
<p>Hemingway decided to move to Paris. Before he did, in America, he married a woman he had recently met. Her name was Hadley Richardson.</p>
<p>Paris was cold and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey.html" title="Grey">grey</a> when Hemingway and his new wife arrived in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>. They lived in one of the poorer parts of the city. Their rooms were small and they did not have water from pipes. But the <i>Toronto Star</i> employed him as its European <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reporter.html" title="Reporter">reporter</a>, so they had enough money for the two of them to live. That job gave Hemingway time to write his stories.</p>
<p>Hemingway enjoyed exploring Paris, learning <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> <a href="../../../c/u/s/Custom.html" title="Custom">customs</a>, and meeting friends. Some of these new friends were artists and writers who had come to the city in the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920s</a>. Among them were poet, Ezra Pound, and writers Gertrude Stein, John Dos Passos, and <a href="../../../f/2E/_/F._Scott_Fitzgerald_ccfe.html" title="F. Scott Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>. Seeing that Hemingway was a good writer, they helped him publish his stories in the United States. He was thankful for their support at the time, but later denied that he had received their help.</p>
<p>Hemingway travelled all over Europe. He wrote about <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace.html" title="Peace">peace</a> conferences, and <a href="../../../b/o/r/Border.html" title="Border">border</a> disputes, as well as sports, skiing, and <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing.html" title="Fishing">fishing</a>. Later he would write about bullfighting in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>. The <i>Toronto Star</i> was pleased with his work, and wanted more of his reports, but Hemingway was busy with his own writing.</p>
<p>He said this: "Sometimes, I would start a new story and could not get it going. Then I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think. I would say to myself: 'All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you know.' So finally, I would write a true sentence and go on from there. It was a wonderful feeling when I had worked well."</p>

<p>Hemingway's first book of small stories was called <i>In Our Time</i>. One of its stories, "Big Two Hearted River," told of the effects of war on a young man who was taking a long fishing trip in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>. Hemingway had learned from his father, when he was a boy, about living in the wild.</p>
<p>The story is about two kinds of <a href="../../../r/i/v/River.html" title="River">rivers</a>. One is calm and clear, and is where the young man fishes. The other is a dark, threatening <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swamp.html" title="Swamp">swamp</a>.</p>
<p>The story shows its main character trying to forget his past, as well as the war. He does not talk much about the war. The reader learns about the young man, not because Hemingway tells his readers what the man thinks, but because he shows that man learning about himself.</p>
<p>One of the best modern American stories, it is often published in collections of best writing.</p>
<p>After the book was published in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>, Hadley and Hemingway returned to the United States for the birth of their son, after which they quickly returned to Paris.</p>

<p>Hemingway was working on a long story. He wanted to publish a novel so he would be recognized as a serious writer. And he wanted the money a novel would earn.</p>
<p>The novel was called <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>. It is about young Americans in Europe after World War One. The war had destroyed their dreams and had given them nothing to replace those dreams. The writer Gertrude Stein later called these people members of "The Lost Generation. "</p>
<p>The book was an immediate success. At the age of 25 Ernest Hemingway was famous.</p>
<p>Many people, however, did not like Hemingway's art because they did not like what he wrote about.</p>
<p>Hemingway's sentences were short, the way he had been taught to write at the Kansas city star newspaper. He wrote about what he knew and felt. He used few descriptive words. His statements were clear and easily understood.</p>
<p>He had learned from earlier writers, like Ring Lardner and Sherwood Anderson, but Hemingway brought something new to his writing. He was able to paint in words what he saw and felt. In later books, sometimes he missed. Sometimes he even looked foolish. But when he was right he was almost perfect.</p>

<p>With the success of his novel, Hemingway became even more popular in Paris. Many people came to see him. One was an American woman, Pauline Pfeiffer. She became Hadley's friend. Then Pauline fell in love with Hemingway.</p>
<p>Hemingway and Pauline saw each other secretly. One time, they went away together on a short trip. Years later, Hemingway wrote about returning home after that trip:</p>
<p>"When I saw Hadley again, I wished I had died before I ever loved anyone but her. She was smiling and the sun was on her lovely face. "</p>
<p>But the marriage was over. Ernest Hemingway and Hadley separated. She kept their son. He agreed to give her money he earned from his books.</p>
<p>In later years, he looked back at his marriage to Hadley as the happiest time of his life.</p>
<p>At twenty-five, Hemingway was living in Paris. He was a famous writer. But the end of his first marriage made him want to leave the place where he had first become famous.</p>
<p>Much later he said, "the city was never to be the same again. When I returned to it, I found it had changed as I had changed. Paris was never the same as when I was poor and very happy."</p>
<p>Hemingway and his new wife returned to the United States in 1928. They settled in Key West, an island with a <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing.html" title="Fishing">fishing</a> port near the southern coast of Florida.</p>

<p>Before leaving Paris, Hemingway sent a collection of his stories to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> to be published. The book of stories, called <i>Men Without Women</i>, was published soon after Hemingway arrived in Key West.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Hemingway_f01d.html" title="Edit section: The Killers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Killers</span></h3>
<p>One of the stories was called "The Killers." In it, Hemingway used a discussion between two men to create a feeling of tension and coming <a href="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/violence" class="extiw" title="wikt:violence">violence</a>. This was a new method of telling a story:</p>
<p>Nick opened the thingy and went into the room. Ole Andreson was lying on the bed with all his clothes on. He had been a heavyweight prizefighter and he was too long for the bed. He lay with his head on two pillows. He did not look at Nick.</p>
<p>"What was it?" He asked.</p>
<p>"I was up at Henry's," Nick said, "and two fellows came in and tied me up and the cook, and they said they were going to kill you. i said go ahead."</p>
<p>It sounded silly when he said it. Ole Andreson said nothing, "they put us out in the kitchen," Nick went on. "They were going to shoot you when you came in to supper."</p>
<p>Ole Andreson looked at the wall and did not say anything. "George thought I ought to come and tell you about it."</p>
<p>"There is not anything I can do about it," Ole Andreson said.</p>
<p>Any new book by Hemingway was an important event for readers. But stories like "The Killers" shocked many people. Some thought there was too much violence in his stories. Others said he only wrote about gunmen, soldiers, fighters, and drinkers.</p>
<p>This made Hemingway angry. He felt that writers should not be judged by those who could not write a story.</p>
<p>Hemingway was happy in Key West. In the morning he wrote, in the afternoon he fished, and at night he went to a public house and drank. One old fisherman said: "Hemingway was a man who talked slowly and very carefully. He asked a lot of questions. And he always wanted to get his information exactly right."</p>

<p>Hemingway and his wife Pauline had a child in Key West.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, he heard that his father had killed himself. Hemingway was shocked. He said, "My father taught me so much. He was the only one I really cared about."</p>
<p>When Hemingway returned to work there was a sadness about his writing that was not there before.</p>
<p>His new book told about an American soldier who served with the Italian army during World War One. He meets an English nurse, and they fall in love. They flee from the army, but she dies during <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childbirth.html" title="Childbirth">childbirth</a>. Some of the events are taken from Hemingway's service in Italy. The book is called <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>.</p>
<p>Part of the book talks about the defeat of the Italian army at a place called Caporetto:</p>
<p>"At noon we were stuck in a muddy road about as nearly as we could figure, ten kilometres from Udine. The rain had stopped during the forenoon and three times we had heard planes coming, seen them pass overhead, watched them go far to the left and heard them bombing on the main highroad. . . .</p>
<p>"Later we were on a road that led to a river. There was a long line of abandoned trucks and carts on a road leading up to a bridge. No one was in sight. The river was high and the bridge had been blown up in the center; the stone arch was fallen into the river and the brown water was going over it. We went up the bank looking for a place to cross. . . . we did not see any troops; only abandoned trucks and stores. Along the river bank was nothing and no one but the wet brush and muddy ground.

<p><i>A Farewell to Arms</i> was very successful. It earned Hemingway a great deal of money. It permitted him to travel.</p>
<p>One place he visited was <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, a country he loved. He said, "I want to paint with words all the sights and sounds and smells of Spain. And if I can write any of it down truly, then it will represent all of Spain."</p>
<p>He wrote a book called <i>Death in the Afternoon</i>. It describes the Spanish custom of bull fighting. Hemingway believed that bull fighting was an art, just as much as writing was an art. And he believed it was a true test of a man's bravery, something that always concerned him.</p>

<p>Hemingway also travelled to <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>. He had been asked to write a series of reports about African hunting. He said, "Hunting in Africa is the kind of hunting I like. No riding in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car.html" title="Car">cars</a>, just simple walking and feeling the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grass.html" title="Grass">grass</a> under my feet."</p>
<p>The trip to Africa resulted in a book called <i>The Green Hills of Africa</i> and many smaller stories.</p>
<p>One story is one of Hemingway's best. The story, called <i>The Snows of Kilimanjaro</i>, tells of Hemingway's fears about himself. It is about a writer who betrays his <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art.html" title="Art">art</a> for <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">money</a> and is unable to remain true to himself.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, the Civil War in Spain gave him a chance to return to Spain and test his bravery again. He agreed to write about the war for an American news organization.</p>
<p>It was a dangerous job. One day, Hemingway and two other reporters were driving a car near a battlefield. The car carried two white flags to show they were not fighting. But rebel gunners thought the car was carrying enemy <a href="../../../o/f/f/Officer.html" title="Officer">officers</a>. Hemingway was almost killed. Later he said that "<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullet.html" title="Bullet">bullets</a> are all the same. If they do not hit you, there is no story. If they do hit you, then you do not have to write it. "</p>
<p>The trip to Spain resulted in two works: a play called <i>The Fifth Column</i>, and a novel called <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>. The novel tells the story of an American who has chosen to fight against the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascists</a>. He realizes that there are lies and injustice on his side. But he sees no hope except the victory of his side. During the fighting, he escapes his fear of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a> and of being alone. He decides that "he can live as full a life in seventy hours as in seventy years."</p>

<p>The book was a great success. Hemingway enjoyed being famous. His second <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a> was ending. He <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorced</a> Pauline and married reporter Martha Gellhorn. He had met her while they were working in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>. They decided to live in <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, near the city of <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havana.html" title="Havana">Havana</a>. Their house looked out over the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean_Sea_1b1b.html" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>.</p>
<p>But this marriage did not last long. Hemingway was changing. He began to feel that whatever he said was right. Martha went on long trips to be away from him. He drank heavily to forget his loneliness.</p>
<p>When America entered World War Two, Hemingway went to Britain as a reporter. Later he took part in the invasion of Europe and the freeing of Paris.</p>
<p>During the war, Hemingway met another reporter, Mary Walsh. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, when his marriage to Martha was legally over, he married Mary.</p>
<p>After the war, Hemingway began work on his last important book, <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>. It is the story of a Cuban fisherman who refuses to be defeated by nature.</p>
<p>Hemingway said, "I was trying to show the experience of the fisherman so exactly and directly that it became part of the reader's experience."</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>, Hemingway won the <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Prize_c061.html" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a> for Literature. But he was too sick to take part in the ceremony.</p>
<p>Ernest Hemingway was 60 years old, but he said he felt like he was 86. Even worse, he felt that he no longer was able to write. He seemed to be living the story about the writer who had sold his writing skill in order to make money.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>, Ernest Hemingway <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">killed himself</a>. Among the papers he left was one that described what he liked best:</p>
<p>"To stay in places and to leave. . . to trust, to distrust. . . to no longer believe and believe again. . . to watch the changes in the seasons. . . to be out in boats. . . to watch the snow come, to watch it go. . . to hear the rain. . . And to know where I can find what I want."</p>
<p>Ernest Hemingway owned many <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat.html" title="Cat">cats</a>, especially cats with extra toes. Today these cats are sometimes called <i>Hemingway cats</i> in his honor. His house in Key West, Florida is now a home for his cats and their kittens.</p>
