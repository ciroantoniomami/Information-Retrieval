Disneyland celebrated its golden, or 50th, anniversary on July 17, 2005.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../d/i/s/Disneyland.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h3>
<p>Walt Disney worked very hard to run his movie studio. He liked to spend weekends with his two daughters. The family liked going to carnivals and fairs. Mr. Disney wanted to build a place that had all of the fun of the traveling fairs but without the bad people that they attracted. That is how Mr. Disney got the idea for Disneyland. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>, Mr. Disney talked to people at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a>. He asked them to find a place that would be a good place to build his park. The Stanford people recommended an <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange.html" title="Orange">orange</a> grove for sale in Anaheim, a farming area south of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Mr. Disney's friends thought the idea was a crazy one. But he was sure that his dream would be a good one. After selling property that he loved very much in Palm Springs to help pay for the park, the building of Disneyland began in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>. He also used a weekly television show called "Disneyland" to make people want to see his park. In only one year, Disneyland was open.</p>
<p>When Disneyland opened on July 17, 1955, the opening was shown on television as it happened. Mr. Disney asked three of his Hollywood friends to help him: Art Linkletter, Robert Cummings and <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. Many things went wrong that day. 11,000 people were invited to the private event but nearly 30,000 came. The streets were still fresh and many people had their shoes stuck in this. They stepped out of their shoes. Even the running water was a problem, which meant that Mr. Disney had to choose between drinking water and water for flushing toilets. Mr. Disney chose the toilets. Disneyland may have had problems when it opened, but it was not long before it became a success. Visitor number one million came to Disneyland less than two years later.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../d/i/s/Disneyland.html" title="Edit section: The lands of Disneyland">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The lands of Disneyland</span></h3>
<p>Inside Disneyland are several parcels called "lands." Each land has its own theme. This is a list of those lands and some of the things in them.</p>
<p><b>Main Street, U.S.A</b> is the first land people see when they come into Disneyland. It was built to look like a small American town, much like the one Mr. Disney grew up in. A station for the Disneyland Railroad can be found here. The station is located at the entrance to Disneyland. Mr. Disney and some of his workers loved trains and wanted a <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railroad.html" title="Railroad">railroad</a> in their new park. Guests can board <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam.html" title="Steam">steam</a>-powered <a href="../../../t/r/a/Train.html" title="Train">trains</a> for a ride around the edge of Disneyland. They can also ride a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streetcar.html" title="Streetcar">streetcar</a> pulled by a <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horse</a>, a double-deck <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus.html" title="Bus">bus</a> and even a small fire engine. Many shops and restaurants can be found on Main Street, U.S.A.</p>
<p><b>Fantasyland</b> is like the places in old <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairy_tale.html" title="Fairy tale">fairy tales</a>. An <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antique.html" title="Antique">antique</a> carousel from <a href="../../../1/8/7/1875.html" title="1875">1875</a> can be ridden in Fantasyland. The main entry to Fantasyland is through the Sleeping Beauty <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle.html" title="Castle">castle</a>, the <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbol.html" title="Symbol">symbol</a> of Disneyland. Attractions (Disneyland does not use the term "rides") include "Snow White's Scary Adventures and it's a small world.It also includes the Alice in Wonderland attractions. The actual Alice in Wonderland ride allows you to take the adventure just like Alice did and visit the interesting "creatures" she met in Wonderland. The teacups is another Alice attraction where guests get to sit in giant teacups and spin as fast or as slow as you like!</p>
<p><b>Adventureland</b> is made to look like a <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle.html" title="Jungle">jungle</a> in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> or <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>. One of Disneyland's first attractions can be ridden here. It is called "Jungle Cruise" and takes guests on a boat ride on a jungle <a href="../../../r/i/v/River.html" title="River">river</a>.</p>
<p><b>Frontierland</b> is a land that looks like the old <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> West. The <i>Mark Twain,</i> a steam-powered boat called a "paddlewheeler" takes guests for a ride on the "Rivers of America." Guests can also ride "Big Thunder Mountain Railroad," a <a href="../../../r/o/l/Roller_coaster.html" title="Roller coaster">roller coaster</a> that looks like a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mine.html" title="Mine">mine</a> train.</p>
<p><b>Tomorrowland</b> was meant to look like the world of the <a href="../../../f/u/t/Future.html" title="Future">future</a>. Disneyland's newest attraction can be found here. It is called "Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters" and it opened in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. The "Space Mountain" indoor roller coaster, built in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, reopened in 2005 after two years of rebuilding. An old attraction called "<a href="../../../s/u/b/Submarine.html" title="Submarine">Submarine</a> Voyage" is being rebuilt. It will open in 2007 with characters from <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Finding_Nemo_ebf1.html" title="Finding Nemo">Finding Nemo</a></i>.</p>
<p><b>Mickey's Toontown</b> is Disneyland's newest land. It is also its silliest land. Mickey's Toontown is where Mickey Mouse and his friends are supposed to live. It is named "Toontown" after a place in the movie, <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</i></p>
<p><b>New Orleans Square</b> looks like a place called the "French Quarter" in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana_f945.html" title="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>. Two of Disneyland's very popular attractions are in New Orleans Square: "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "The Haunted Mansion (which have both inspired movies)."</p>
<p><b>Critter Country</b> looks like America's deep South of more than 100 years ago. "Splash Mountain" is a very popular log ride that guests wait in line for a long time to enjoy. It ends with a very long (but fun) drop down a <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterfall.html" title="Waterfall">waterfall</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../d/i/s/Disneyland.html" title="Edit section: Disneyland's big day">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Disneyland's big day</span></h3>
<p>Sunday, July 17, 2005 was one of the most important days in Disneyland's history. It was the celebration of opening day exactly fifty years ago. Many people waited to enter the park that morning. Many more spent the night waiting in Disney's California Adventure. A ceremony was held that morning with very important people speaking to the audience. Art Linkletter, who was part of the first television show, was the first to speak. The day was also Mr. Linkletter's 93rd <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birthday.html" title="Birthday">birthday</a>. Michael Eisner and Robert Iger, the top men at the Disney company each gave speeches. <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor.html" title="Governor">governor</a> <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_088f.html" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> gave a speech as did Walt Disney's daughter, Diane Disney Miller. The ceremony was shown on giant <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> screens placed in the park and repeated throughout the day. At 4:45 that afternoon, the exact time the park was dedicated, Walt Disney's opening day speech was played over speakers all over Disneyland.</p>
